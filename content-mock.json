The conference unites library authors and core teams with engineers having a summer Amsterdam as a background. We recognize JavaScript development as an art of engineering, and that's why the conference offers both a JS-driven art exhibition and audiovisual performances powered with JavaScript during the afterparty. The next day after the event, we'll explore the well-known Amsterdam museums together, and later on, we'll gather for a picnic/hangout in the Vondelpark. </p>\n",

We'll see how using popular patterns like Higher Order Components, Compound Components, Render Props etc. can help us in simplifying things, making our components more reusable and our apps more declarative.</p>\n<p>React 16 comes with some major changes and an update to the core algorithm.

But no more as the <code>&#x3C;Suspense /></code> component makes life much easier.\nAnother case is performance of larger and complex applications. Usually React is fast enough but with a large application rendering components can conflict with user interactions. Concurrent rendering will, mostly automatically, take care of this.</p>\n<p>Join Maurice with your laptop in this interactive workshop. You will learn all about using <Suspense />, showing loading indicators and handling errors. You will see how easy it is to get started with concurrent rendering.

    "description": "<p>When we established our JS meetup 9 years ago, we never imagined we would welcome up to 1400 attendees at our events and organize 4 meetups and multiple spin-offs in Europe. Our secret? We welcome people from all walks of life in our community, and we are a proud partner of initiatives like Unicorns in Tech, the global tech network for LGBT professionals and straight allies.</p>\n<p>We know that supporting diversity inside and outside IT must not end at mere statements, which is why are now developing diversity scholarship programs that will be announced in the coming weeks.</p>\n",
