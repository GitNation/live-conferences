When I'm not deep into React, React Native, or Node.js, you’ll likely find me organizing GDG Toruń meetups, where we exchange ideas and experiences. I don’t believe in sticking to just one \"perfect\" library or framework; every tool has its own strengths, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. I’m also passionate about contributing to open-source projects like Astro, with the goal of making the web a better place.</p>\n",

I don’t believe in sticking to just one \"perfect\" library or framework; every tool has its own strengths, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution.

We discuss this briefly in this PodRocket episode where the Vercel CTO says it could be game changing. In this talk, we teach developers how to implement such functionality in their applications.",

I don’t believe in sticking to just one \"perfect\" library or framework; every tool has its own strengths, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. I’m also passionate about contributing to open-source projects like Astro, with the goal of making the web a better place.",

When I'm not deep into React, React Native, or Node.js, you’ll likely find me organizing GDG Toruń meetups, where we exchange ideas and experiences. I don’t believe in sticking to just one \"perfect\" library or framework; every tool has its own strengths, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. I’m also passionate about contributing to open-source projects like Astro, with the goal of making the web a better place.",

This will give everyone a better understanding of where the client/server boundaries are and how \"\"use client\"\" and component imports work together to decide what code gets executed by the RSC server and what code gets executed in the user's browser. This understanding is generally applicable to any RSC enabled framework (which mostly means NextJS right now).</p><p><br /></p><p>Now, with the audience equipped with a better understanding of RSCs I'll dive into the RSC Payload (aka Flight) format explaining what it is and how it works.

I don’t believe in sticking to just one \"perfect\" library or framework; every tool has its own strengths, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. I’m also passionate about contributing to open-source projects like Astro, with the goal of making the web a better place.",

Everyone is looking forward to being saved from the re-render plague and never having to write useCallback/useMemo again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But are we truly there yet? Can the React Compiler actually achieve those things? Do we need to do anything other than turning it on and enjoying a re-render-free life? I ran it on a few real-world apps to find the answer. Want to see the results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk, we’ll take a look at what the React Compiler is, what problems it solves, and how it performs on simple code examples and real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;performance&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:0,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;how-react-compiler-performs-on-real-code&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;how-react-compiler-performs-on-real-code&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;nadia-makarevich&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} });

To opt into the bare workflow, one has to \&quot;prebuild\&quot; one&#39;s apps to expose all the native boilerplate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expo Prebuild is widely used, but it can be a little unclear exactly what it does and how it does it all (such as how it can bring your native project back up to date after you bump the Expo SDK version). In particular, its capability of generating native projects from custom templates is underused.

In this workshop we will explore the new APIs, discuss the benefits and highlight the potential pitfalls to give you a head start for using these new features in your applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to get a deep understanding of these new APIs we will explore the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React Server Components introduction including how client/server boundaries behave&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;React Server Components pitfalls (e.g. data leaks, initial render)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;New &amp;#x26; newish hooks: use(Promise|Context), useActionState, useFormStatus, useOptimistic, useTransition, useDeferredValue&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Getting the most out of React leveraging Suspense&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The workshop is split into several modules. Each of them starts with a 20 min presentation, 30-50 min coding session and is followed by a 10 min retrospective.
