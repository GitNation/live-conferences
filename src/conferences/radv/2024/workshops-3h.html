When I'm not deep into React, React Native, or Node.js, you’ll likely find me organizing GDG Toruń meetups, where we exchange ideas and experiences. I don’t believe in sticking to just one \"perfect\" library or framework; every tool has its own strengths, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. I’m also passionate about contributing to open-source projects like Astro, with the goal of making the web a better place.",

Yet in the frontend world, we're behind the curve.Join me as I dive into the tools and techniques we can use to instrument, monitor and diagnose issues in our production React applications. I'll cover RUM agents and React framework extensions, and the metrics and traces they provide, how to combine them with backend tracing for a holistic picture, and how Synthetic Monitoring and alerting in Observability platforms can help us be alerted to issues impacting users in the UIs we build and maintain.",

                        "text": "<p>The talk will start with a quick introduction to React Server Components and then move on to show how they're visualized in one of the developer tools we've built for RedwoodJS. This will give everyone a better understanding of where the client/server boundaries are and how \"\"use client\"\" and component imports work together to decide what code gets executed by the RSC server and what code gets executed in the user's browser. This understanding is generally applicable to any RSC enabled framework (which mostly means NextJS right now).</p><p><br /></p><p>Now, with the audience equipped with a better understanding of RSCs I'll dive into the RSC Payload (aka Flight) format explaining what it is and how it works. For this part of the talk I will use a tool we've built to record and visualize the RSC network traffic to aid me in explaining the RSC protocol. I will also show how it helps developers identify bottlenecks by showing payload sizes and request durations.</p><p><br /></p><p>After attending my talk, the audience will have a much deeper understanding of how RSCs work, all the way down to the RSC protocol level. They will also be excited and eager to explore our state-of-the-art RSC app developer tooling.</p>\n",

I don’t believe in sticking to just one \"perfect\" library or framework; every tool has its own strengths, and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution. I’m also passionate about contributing to open-source projects like Astro, with the goal of making the web a better place.",

                  <p>Knowledge of AI tooling is critical for future-proofing the careers of React developers, and the Vercel suite of AI tools is an approachable on-ramp. In this course, we’ll take a closer look at the Vercel AI SDK and how this can help React developers build streaming interfaces with JavaScript and Next.js. We’ll also incorporate additional 3rd party APIs to build and deploy a music visualization app.</p>
