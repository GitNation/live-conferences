This talk will be about personal experiences, unpopular opinions and even actions, and anything else that might be counterintuitive.

I've been leading open source projects, short lived projects as a freelancer and I went through the transition of engineer to tech lead twice. Both at a young startup and at Meta. This talk will be about personal experiences, unpopular opinions and even actions, and anything else that might be counterintuitive. Join for some take-aways for anyone aiming at an engineering focused career. Probably I will be wrong about most things, so don’t miss the opportunity to follow up afterwards!",

                "description": "Next.js has grown in popularity over the past couple of years with features like server-side rendering, incremental static regeneration, image optimization, and more. Next.js is known as the production ready framework for React. In contrast, GraphQL is known for not just returning data for what you need with good schema design practices but also a good dev experience.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll talk about how one can build an app that not just scales but also has high performance with Next.js, GraphQL and Tailwind. And Lastly, the future of CSS and Frontend development is building utilities, so CSS does not feel like an afterthought. At the end of this talk, you will learn how to go from making a sample app to a highly performant production-ready application.",

It seems that we are quite the vulnerable population - or rather, it seems like a lot of ADHD people are drawn towards a developer job.\n\nIn this talk, I want to tell you about myself, how ADHD affected me and how the late diagnosis changed my life.\nBut it didn't only change my life - it also affected everyone around me. As colleagues, we have found a new level of understanding with each other that helped us more than any team-building event.

We will discuss the impact this will have on developing React Native projects. Lastly, we will cover what we learned from the React Native New Architecture migration at Meta, and how you can tackle your migration in your organization.",

We will discuss the impact this will have on developing React Native projects. Lastly, we will cover what we learned from the React Native New Architecture migration at Meta, and how you can tackle your migration in your organization.",

Have you ever thought of building one of your own? In this talk, I will share my journey building jest-preview, from when it was just a vague idea, to currently a well-adopted library to help frontend engineers write tests faster. I will share with you how to come up with an idea for a project to work on, what is the struggles you have to overcome as an author of an open source project, how to manage time efficiently, and how you get attention from engineers around the world.",

The advantage of a service based approach is to increase agility and shorten the build and release development cycle.  And more recently the rise of micro frontends means that this approach not only encompasses backend application but also frontend development. However one side effect is increased complexity of the codebase. Resulting in challenges in terms of visibility into how components relate, who owns a component and the impact of activities on dependent components. This session will touch on these challenges and what is needed to maintain individual developer velocity.",

                "description": "The transition from a monolithic architecture to a service based approach began a number of years ago. The advantage of a service based approach is to increase agility and shorten the build and release development cycle.  And more recently the rise of micro frontends means that this approach not only encompasses backend application but also frontend development. However one side effect is increased complexity of the codebase. Resulting in challenges in terms of visibility into how components relate, who owns a component and the impact of activities on dependent components. This session will touch on these challenges and what is needed to maintain individual developer velocity.",

How can Amplify help you break out of that box and work on whatever you want, from design to deployment without losing momentum?",

What's more, depending on how tightly we couple our systems and services, they can interact unexpectedly and unfortunately with existing software or hardware. Beyond unintended consequences, we can also find that people can use our services for nefarious purposes. It's essential to have safety nets in place when things don't go as planned or people attempt to break the rules. In this session, we'll discuss how feature flags can work in both temporary and permanent scenarios to enable you to break the quality triangle and deliver quality promptly.",

This talk will be about personal experiences, unpopular opinions and even actions, and anything else that might be counterintuitive.
