This talk will be about personal experiences, unpopular opinions and even actions, and anything else that might be counterintuitive.

I've been leading open source projects, short lived projects as a freelancer and I went through the transition of engineer to tech lead twice. Both at a young startup and at Meta. This talk will be about personal experiences, unpopular opinions and even actions, and anything else that might be counterintuitive.

                "description": "Typically I talk a lot about deeply technical concepts like TypeScript, type systems, (im)mutability, MobX, Immer etc. But this time it's going to be personal and I'll share lessons, good and bad, about growing as an engineer. I've been leading open source projects, short lived projects as a freelancer and I went through the transition of engineer to tech lead twice. Both at a young startup and at Meta. This talk will be about personal experiences, unpopular opinions and even actions, and anything else that might be counterintuitive. Join for some take-aways for anyone aiming at an engineering focused career. Probably I will be wrong about most things, so don’t miss the opportunity to follow up afterwards!",

                "description": "Next.js has grown in popularity over the past couple of years with features like server-side rendering, incremental static regeneration, image optimization, and more. Next.js is known as the production ready framework for React. In contrast, GraphQL is known for not just returning data for what you need with good schema design practices but also a good dev experience.\n\nIn this talk, I’ll talk about how one can build an app that not just scales but also has high performance with Next.js, GraphQL and Tailwind. And Lastly, the future of CSS and Frontend development is building utilities, so CSS does not feel like an afterthought. At the end of this talk, you will learn how to go from making a sample app to a highly performant production-ready application.",

It seems that we are quite the vulnerable population - or rather, it seems like a lot of ADHD people are drawn towards a developer job.\n\nIn this talk, I want to tell you about myself, how ADHD affected me and how the late diagnosis changed my life.\nBut it didn't only change my life - it also affected everyone around me. As colleagues, we have found a new level of understanding with each other that helped us more than any team-building event. And in the end, made us more productive since we now know how to better use our individual strengths, instead of trying to meet social expectations.\n\nI will also talk about general ADHD symptoms and try to give you a rough overview on the topic - what kinds of treatments exist, what kind of coping strategies there are and where the line between \"everybody is a bit forgetful\" and \"ADHD is an illness\" lies.\n\nYou might recognize yourself in this. Or just a close friend or colleague. Either way, this talk will give you awareness & insights how the mind of a neurodivergent person can work differently - or it may even be an important wake-up-call.\n\nDisclaimer: while I have an interest in the topic and am personally affected, I am not a trained professional on the topic and everything you hear here can only be an inspiration, but never medical advice.",

We will discuss the impact this will have on developing React Native projects. Lastly, we will cover what we learned from the React Native New Architecture migration at Meta, and how you can tackle your migration in your organization.",

                "description": "At the end of 2021, we successfully rolled out the New React Native Architecture in the Facebook app.\n\nNow, it’s time to empower every React Native developer on the globe to use the New React Native Architecture, both the new Fabric renderer and the new TurboModule system.\n\nBut migrating an entire ecosystem to a New Architecture is no easy task.\n\nTo support the whole community in this endeavour, we lined up a set of tools and materials that will help both app and library developers to join us in this journey.\n\nIn the talk, we will present how the New React Native Architecture looks in the OSS space. We will discuss the impact this will have on developing React Native projects. Lastly, we will cover what we learned from the React Native New Architecture migration at Meta, and how you can tackle your migration in your organization.",

Have you ever thought of building one of your own? In this talk, I will share my journey building jest-preview, from when it was just a vague idea, to currently a well-adopted library to help frontend engineers write tests faster. I will share with you how to come up with an idea for a project to work on, what is the struggles you have to overcome as an author of an open source project, how to manage time efficiently, and how you get attention from engineers around the world.",

However one side effect is increased complexity of the codebase. Resulting in challenges in terms of visibility into how components relate, who owns a component and the impact of activities on dependent components. This session will touch on these challenges and what is needed to maintain individual developer velocity.",

                "description": "Creating and deploying new software is risky. We've all seen how easily bugs arise, causing software to be poorly delivered or to the wrong people. What's more, depending on how tightly we couple our systems and services, they can interact unexpectedly and unfortunately with existing software or hardware. Beyond unintended consequences, we can also find that people can use our services for nefarious purposes. It's essential to have safety nets in place when things don't go as planned or people attempt to break the rules. In this session, we'll discuss how feature flags can work in both temporary and permanent scenarios to enable you to break the quality triangle and deliver quality promptly.",

This talk will be about personal experiences, unpopular opinions and even actions, and anything else that might be counterintuitive.

                              <p>Shopify's Hydrogen framework has been released with an early version of React's server components. In this talk I will discuss:</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>What is Hydrogen?</li>
                                <li>What are server component and how are we using them?</li>
                                <li>How are they different than client and shared components?</li>
                                <li>How are server side rendering and server components different?</li>
                                <li>I'll also show examples in the wild</li>
                              </ul>
                              <p>After the talk I hope the attendees will understand the Hydrogen framework and React server components better.</p>

                            <p>Server components is an exciting new feature introduced in React 18. It lets us leverage the fast performance of the server by offloading work behind a component to the server. Why would we want to do that? because server has direct access to data source .so fetching data, making aPI calls would be really fast on the server.</p>
                            <p>The most amazing thing about RSC is that they add 0 kb to the client bundle. So not only RSC reduces the bundle-size but will also improve page load times, eventually providing better user experience.</p>
                            <p>In this talk I will be talking about what react server components are, why do we need them . RSC is often confused with SSR but we will see how they are fundamentally different.</p>
                            <p>We will create a small react application using server components and see the performance benefits. We will also see the challenges we might face when we use RSC in our normal react application. Finally we deep dive into React’s brain and see how things are happening under the hood.</p>

I will share with you how to come up with an idea for a project to work on, what is the struggles you have to overcome as an author of an open source project, how to manage time efficiently, and how you get attention from engineers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;time&quot;:&quot;2022-10-24T20:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;dayISO&quot;:&quot;2022-10-24T00:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:&quot;Cousteau Track&quot;,&quot;place&quot;:&quot;Full-time Open Source Contributor, Vietnam&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;how-to-build-your-own-open-source-project&quot;,&quot;speakerSlug&quot;:&quot;hung-nguyen&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;03b4712293184731b7d1bf074302f8e0&quot;,&quot;isLightning&quot;:false,&quot;isoDate&quot;:&quot;2022-10-24T20:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;speaker&quot;:&quot;Hung Nguyen&quot;,&quot;from&quot;:&quot;Full-time Open Source Contributor, Vietnam&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;talk--undefined&quot;,&quot;lightningTalks&quot;:null,&quot;bgColor&quot;:&quot;#ccff00&quot;} })

Let’s check out together what a React Native app looks like under the hood. It will help us to be more efficient on a daily basis. We’ll identify the shortest steps to execute daily actions, like starting our apps as fast as possible (no more unnecessary compilations of native modules!), or dealing with pesky red errors that metro throws at us.</p>

                            <p>"Hi, my name is Lenz and two years ago I was diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder)." Well, this is not going to be a self-help-group, but I think it is important to talk about this wildly underrepresented topic.</p>
                            <p>Since my diagnosis, I have spent a lot of time talking to other developers about it - and many of them also have ADHD, often a late diagnosis. It seems that we are quite the vulnerable population - or rather, it seems like a lot of ADHD people are drawn towards a developer job.</p>
                            <p>In this talk, I want to tell you about myself, how ADHD affected me and how the late diagnosis changed my life. But it didn't only change my life - it also affected everyone around me. As colleagues, we have found a new level of understanding with each other that helped us more than any team-building event. And in the end, made us more productive since we now know how to better use our individual strengths, instead of trying to meet social expectations.</p>
                            <p>I will also talk about general ADHD symptoms and try to give you a rough overview on the topic - what kinds of treatments exist, what kind of coping strategies there are and where the line between "everybody is a bit forgetful" and "ADHD is an illness" lies.</p>
                            <p>You might recognize yourself in this. Or just a close friend or colleague. Either way, this talk will give you awareness &#x26; insights how the mind of a neurodivergent person can work differently - or it may even be an important wake-up-call.</p>
                            <p>Disclaimer: while I have an interest in the topic and am personally affected, I am not a trained professional on the topic and everything you hear here can only be an inspiration, but never medical advice.</p>

                            <p>React is so powerful that it can be used for more than frontend development. E.g. creating UI programmatically in the backend using a rule-based system or machine learning is another use case where React can serve as the best fit. Similarly, documentation earlier used to have only .md files but now it also includes .mdx file that contains React code. To fulfill such use cases, developers need to understand the internals of React and the tooling around it. Some great sources are popular codebases such as create-react-app, Next.js, etc.</p>
                            <p>In this talk, I will share the lessons we learnt while creating a framework that achieves more than web development using React. </p>
                            <p>Firstly, I will cover how create-react-app codebase is the best codebase to understand how webpack, babel, eslint, typescript etc. can be used alongside React. </p>
                            <p>Secondly, I will share how Next.js teaches us to create a js framework where we can write backend and frontend in the same file and still be able to separate the two during calls. </p>
                            <p>Thirdly, I will share how our framework supports plugins, i.e. the React code resides in multiple repositories but all of this code can share a single React runtime inside the browser.
