              "bio": "<p>In 2013, I graduated with a BFA and took my first job as a Junior Graphic Designer at a small, boutique ad agency. While there, my Creative Director warned me to never let anyone find out I could code, because if I did I'd be stuck doing it forever. I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.</p>\n",

I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.",

Zelda is incidentally also the name of his dog.",

Engineers of any level are welcome, but be prepared for hardcore.</p>

I am a self-taught developer I am currently working as CTO at Pedals Up Blockchain Studio &amp;#x26; Polygon Advocate. I started my coding journey in 2009. That was the first time when I ran my first code in the C language “Hello World!”. Then after there was no look back, I learned C, C++, Html, CSS, Javascript, Python, SQL and many more technical languages &amp;#x26; frameworks. I am always a curious person about technology. When I started working in the industry, I worked with various Startup Companies across the globe, like Elemetor, KDE(GSOC), Wikimedia(GSOC), Mokko(USA Based), Dataone, Pycon Taiwan, etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am also a community builder. I started my first community at college with the help of some of my friends, Then after I started contributing to other communities like Makerfest, GDG Ahmedabad, Echai, Pydata, and IIT-B Ecell. Currently, I am a co-organizer of GDG Cloud Ahmedabad &amp;#x26; Pydata Ahmedabad. I am also a Polygon Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have given more than 30+ talks on several topics like Google Cardboard (VR), Google Cloud Tech (GCP), Python tech, React Js, React Native, and Design Systems at the Local &amp;#x26; Global levels.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am also working on Web 3 space for the last 3 years. And worked with more than 10+ startups in the Web 3 space. We at Pedals Up(company) work with clients like, Biconomy, Nord Finance, Pillow Funds, Scallop, Kalamint, NFT, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;socials&quot;:[{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/harshcrop&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;gh&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://portal.gitnation.org/person/harsh_shah&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;portal&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/harshcrop&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;tw&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://medium.com/@harshcrop&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;site&quot;}],&quot;tagBG&quot;:&quot;black&quot;,&quot;color&quot;:&quot;white&quot;,&quot;activities&quot;:{&quot;talks&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1510,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Simplifying Data Management in React With React Query&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;This talk is about how React Query can simplify data management in React applications.

Currently, I am a co-organizer of GDG Cloud Ahmedabad &#x26; Pydata Ahmedabad. I am also a Polygon Advocate.</p>
                    <p>I have given more than 30+ talks on several topics like Google Cardboard (VR), Google Cloud Tech (GCP), Python tech, React Js, React Native, and Design Systems at the Local &#x26; Global levels.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I am also working on Web 3 space for the last 3 years. And worked with more than 10+ startups in the Web 3 space. We at Pedals Up(company) work with clients like, Biconomy, Nord Finance, Pillow Funds, Scallop, Kalamint, NFT, and so on.</p>

                  <div class="team__info">
                    <p>I've always been excited by the web. React is so obviously the right DX for building UIs, isn't it? But the whole stack is quite complex, especially if you want to build apps with realtime multiplayer/collaboration features. I want to make that easier and am on a mission to build an open-source framework to help with that.</p>
