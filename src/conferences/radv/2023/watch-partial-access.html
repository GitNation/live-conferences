While there, my Creative Director warned me to never let anyone find out I could code, because if I did I'd be stuck doing it forever. I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.</p>\n",

Then after there was no look back, I learned C, C++, Html, CSS, Javascript, Python, SQL and many more technical languages &#x26; frameworks. I am always a curious person about technology. When I started working in the industry, I worked with various Startup Companies across the globe, like Elemetor, KDE(GSOC), Wikimedia(GSOC), Mokko(USA Based), Dataone, Pycon Taiwan, etc.</p>\n<p>I am also a community builder. I started my first community at college with the help of some of my friends, Then after I started contributing to other communities like Makerfest, GDG Ahmedabad, Echai, Pydata, and IIT-B Ecell.

React's internals are a black box, and it's often hard to understand why components rendered or what caused errors.The Replay time-travel debugger makes it easier to debug React apps by letting you inspect what's happening at any point in time. But what if we could go beyond the usual debugger features, and build new debugging features that tell us more about what React is doing? Let's see how Replay's API makes that possible.",

While there, my Creative Director warned me to never let anyone find out I could code, because if I did I'd be stuck doing it forever. I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.",

Zelda is incidentally also the name of his dog.",
