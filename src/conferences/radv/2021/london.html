But what if new entries are being added or updated at a rate of hundreds per second? And what if the user should be able to filter and sort them freely? How can we stay responsive in such scenarios? In this talk we discuss how Flipper introduced map-reduce inspired FSRW transformations to handle such scenarios gracefully. By applying the techniques introduced in this talk Flipper frame rates increased at least 10-fold and we hope to open source this approach soon.</p>\n",

                "text": "<p>If youâre building a dashboard, analytics platform, or any web app where you need to give your users insight into their data, you need beautiful, custom, interactive data visualizations in your React app. But building visualizations by hand with a low-level library like D3 can be a huge headache, involving lots of wheel-reinventing. In this talk, weâll see how data viz development can get so much easier thanks to tools like Plot, a high-level dataviz library for quick &#x26; easy charting, and Observable, a reactive dataviz prototyping environment, both from the creator of D3. Through live coding examples weâll explore how React refs let us delegate DOM manipulation for our data visualizations, and how Observableâs embedding functionality lets us easily repurpose community-built visualizations for our own data &#x26; use cases. By the end of this talk weâll know how to get a beautiful, customized, interactive data visualization into our apps with a fraction of the time &#x26; effort!</p>\n",

Add this to its new suspense SSR capabilities, and we get an paradigm shift in the world of client/server side rendering. A new era of web development. In this talk we'll deep dive into this interesting and experimental feature, understand what it solves, how to (not over-)use it, talk about the state of the art practices regarding server rendering, and maybe get a glimpse into the exciting future of front-back-full-stack relationships.",

With this growing complexity comes a growing need for knowledge from the developers creating it, as they have to deal with matters like state-management, authorization, routing and more. In this talk, I'll show you how to use GraphQL in your Next.js application to create a data layer for your application, that exists between your frontend and your backend. In this data layer, you can handle complex matters to help you to keep your frontend application clean and \"stupid\".",

Why do we still need so much boilerplate to manage state with the Context API? What if we donât want to be constrained by opinionated tools like Redux Toolkit or forced to use actions and reducers in our React applications? \nThis is where Hookstate comes in. Hookstate is not just another state management solution. Apart from being feature-rich, fast, and flexible, the library takes the idea of simplifying state management in React apps to a whole new level. In this talk, Iâll introduce Hookstate as a simple and efficient state management solution for React applications.",

                    "description": "If youâve worked with the React useState hook before, you might have wondered why global state management canât be just as easy. Why do we still need so much boilerplate to manage state with the Context API? What if we donât want to be constrained by opinionated tools like Redux Toolkit or forced to use actions and reducers in our React applications? \nThis is where Hookstate comes in. Hookstate is not just another state management solution. Apart from being feature-rich, fast, and flexible, the library takes the idea of simplifying state management in React apps to a whole new level. In this talk, Iâll introduce Hookstate as a simple and efficient state management solution for React applications.",

                  <p>The React ecosystem and community have grown drastically in the past years, and so did the complexity of web and JavaScript app development. It's highly recommended to take this journey with the help of others â so connect with the global network of field experts and explore the framework! Engineers of any level are welcome, but be prepared for hardcore.</p>
                  <p>There will be 2 tracks of talks: General &#x26; Pro tracks.</p>
                  <p>This year, the format of the event will be hybrid, with the first day streamed from the London venue including hybrid networking features and interactive entertainment; and second day, as well as the numerous free workshops, streamed to the global audience online. </p>

Riding on the render-everything-in-server wave with its shiny new toy - React creates a way to define for parts of the component tree to be rendered in the server, or the client, or both. Add this to its new suspense SSR capabilities, and we get an paradigm shift in the world of client/server side rendering. A new era of web development. In this talk we&#39;ll deep dive into this interesting and experimental feature, understand what it solves, how to (not over-)use it, talk about the state of the art practices regarding server rendering, and maybe get a glimpse into the exciting future of front-back-full-stack relationships.&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;General Track&quot;,&quot;isPrimary&quot;:true},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;dear-client-i-m-leaving-you&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;liad-yosef&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} })

                      <p>React 18 introduces new APIs for rendering applications asynchronously on the server, enabling a simpler model for architecting and shipping user interfaces. When deployed on edge networking platforms like Cloudflare Workers, we can get dramatic performance and user experience improvements in our applications. In this talk, Sunil will demo and walk through this new model of writing React applications, with some insight into the implications for data fetching, styling, and overall direction of the React ecosystem.</p>

                    <div class="schedule-list__info">
                      <p>There is generally a good understanding on how to render large (say, 100K items) datasets using virtual lists, â¦if they remain largely static. But what if new entries are being added or updated at a rate of hundreds per second? And what if the user should be able to filter and sort them freely? How can we stay responsive in such scenarios? In this talk we discuss how Flipper introduced map-reduce inspired FSRW transformations to handle such scenarios gracefully. By applying the techniques introduced in this talk Flipper frame rates increased at least 10-fold and we hope to open source this approach soon.</p>

                      <p>Common myths about Micro-Frontends hold that they are bad for performance or that developers implementing this architectural style donât care about the performance implications because they are focusing on fixing the developer experience and organizational issues rather than focusing on the user experience, however, the reality is altogether different. Micro-Frontends are not inheritably bad for performance and, as is often the case in software development, making best use of the technology depends on correct implementation. This talk will demonstrate how Micro-Frontends can make your applications faster and more resilient while keeping the benefits of independent deployments.</p>

                      <p>Humans are natural problem solvers and we're good enough at it that we've survived over the centuries and become the dominant species of the planet. Because we're so good at it, we sometimes become problem seekers tooâlooking for problems we can solve. Those who most successfully accomplish their goals are the problem eliminators. Let's talk about the distinction between solving and eliminating problems with examples from inside and outside the coding world.</p>

                        <p>Why are we devs so obsessed with decoupling things that are coupled by nature? tRPC is a library that replaces the need for GraphQL or REST for internal APIs. When using it, you simply write backend functions whose input and output shapes are instantly inferred in your frontend without any code generation; making writing API schemas a thing of the past. It's lightweight, not tied to React, HTTP-cacheable, and can be incrementally adopted. </p>
                        <p>In this talk, I'll give a glimpse of the DX you can get from tRPC and how (and why) to get started.</p>

                        <p>Developers often look at abstractions as being "the closer to the metal, the better," meaning that as abstractions become further removed from the lowest possible level, the more you give up in terms of performance and features. But abstractions work as a spectrum also. We'll look at how we can adjust our view of abstractions and what kind of examples we can use to better understand that abstractions have less to do with programming and more to do with where we deploy.</p>

                        <p>In this talk, Iâll walk through the different types of code search, tools &#x26; software, and advanced tips &#x26; tricks to navigate any type of codebase easily. With the advent of large code repositories and sophisticated search capabilities, code search is increasingly becoming a key software development activity. Every developer in the world that spends an insane amount of time reading rather than writing code should have access to the best code search tools that amplifies their productivity.

                      <p>All the React you've seen is presented one way: as a linear text file. There's good reason for this. Textual syntax is an ideal medium for constructing abstract logic. It's quick to write, informationally dense, and endlessly flexible. However, brevity has its downsides. What information can't we see in static text? How can visual representations and metaphorical comparisons expand our understanding of how React works? Come find out what happens when we explore alternate ways of seeing React.</p>

                      <p>Decentralized apps (dApps) are continuing to gain momentum in the industry. These developers are also now some of the highest paid in the entire trade. Building decentralized apps is a paradigm shift that requires a different way of thinking than apps built with traditional centralized infrastructure, tooling, and services â taking into consideration things like game theory, decentralized serverless infrastructure, and cryptoeconomics. As a React developer, I initially had a hard time understanding this entirely new (to me) ecosystem, how everything fit together, and the mental model needed to understand and be a productive full stack developer in this space (and why I would consider it in the first place). In this talk, I'll give a comprehensive overview of the space, how you can get started building these types of applications, and the entire tech stack broken apart then put back together to show how everything works.</p>

Between SSG, SSR, DSG, ISR and DPR, the Jamstack has recently seen a flurry of new rendering modes that work for every use case that seemed unviable in the past.

                      <p>If youâre building a dashboard, analytics platform, or any web app where you need to give your users insight into their data, you need beautiful, custom, interactive data visualizations in your React app. But building visualizations by hand with a low-level library like D3 can be a huge headache, involving lots of wheel-reinventing. In this talk, weâll see how data viz development can get so much easier thanks to tools like Plot, a high-level dataviz library for quick &#x26; easy charting, and Observable, a reactive dataviz prototyping environment, both from the creator of D3. Through live coding examples weâll explore how React refs let us delegate DOM manipulation for our data visualizations, and how Observableâs embedding functionality lets us easily repurpose community-built visualizations for our own data &#x26; use cases. By the end of this talk weâll know how to get a beautiful, customized, interactive data visualization into our apps with a fraction of the time &#x26; effort!</p>

                        <p>Google &#x26; Facebook Engineers are able to search over their gargantuan codebase using an internal code search engine. The search engine accelerates the ability of their developers (both old &#x26; new) to understand any part of their codebase &#x26; start contributing immediately! What about the rest of us?</p>
                        <p>In this talk, Iâll walk through the different types of code search, tools &#x26; software, and advanced tips &#x26; tricks to navigate any type of codebase easily. With the advent of large code repositories and sophisticated search capabilities, code search is increasingly becoming a key software development activity. Every developer in the world that spends an insane amount of time reading rather than writing code should have access to the best code search tools that amplifies their productivity. The audience will walk away with everything they need to confidently onboard, navigate &#x26; understand any small, medium-sized and daunting codebase.</p>

                        <p>Why are we devs so obsessed with decoupling things that are coupled by nature? tRPC is a library that replaces the need for GraphQL or REST for internal APIs. When using it, you simply write backend functions whose input and output shapes are instantly inferred in your frontend without any code generation; making writing API schemas a thing of the past. It's lightweight, not tied to React, HTTP-cacheable, and can be incrementally adopted. </p>
                        <p>In this talk, I'll give a glimpse of the DX you can get from tRPC and how (and why) to get started.</p>

                        <p>Developers often look at abstractions as being "the closer to the metal, the better," meaning that as abstractions become further removed from the lowest possible level, the more you give up in terms of performance and features. But abstractions work as a spectrum also. We'll look at how we can adjust our view of abstractions and what kind of examples we can use to better understand that abstractions have less to do with programming and more to do with where we deploy.</p>

                      <p>Before the dawn of some of the most popular frameworks (read: React and Vue), there was Web components. Web Components take one of the best parts of these frameworks (reusable components) and combine it with the best parts of web development (native browser support and not needing to set up a build process). As if that's not enough, web components allow you use the same functions across any framework.</p>
                      <p>If at this point, you're wondering "If web components are so awesome, why haven't I heard about them before?", then you're in luck because that's exactly what this talk is about.</p>
                      <p>In this presentation, we'll take a look at what web components are, why web components are awesome, why web components can be a pain and how we can use web components both as a standalone tool and together with frameworks.</p>

                      <p>This talk looks at how components in React have evolved. We'll look back at previous versions of React, the headlining features, and how milestones like Fiber and Concurrent changed how we wrote React components. Some more details: I want to give attendees a glimpse of how React components looked at different major points in the history of React. Components written in 2013 don't look like components written in 2015 or today. This is a history of React that for some will be a walk down memory lane and for others, completely new information.</p>

How easily can they get up and running, can they extend it with their ideal toolchain and how well will it scale?

                        <p>If youâve worked with the React useState hook before, you might have wondered why global state management canât be just as easy. Why do we still need so much boilerplate to manage state with the Context API? What if we donât want to be constrained by opinionated tools like Redux Toolkit or forced to use actions and reducers in our React applications? This is where Hookstate comes in. Hookstate is not just another state management solution. Apart from being feature-rich, fast, and flexible, the library takes the idea of simplifying state management in React apps to a whole new level. In this talk, Iâll introduce Hookstate as a simple and efficient state management solution for React applications.</p>

                      <p>Thereâs no arguing that building accessible websites is a force for good. But ensuring that our React websites and apps work for everyone can be time-consuming and isnât always easy to get right. Luckily, investing a little bit of time on your accessibility workflow and setting up a series of automated tools will end up saving you tons of time and energy in the long run.</p>
                      <p>In this talk I will demonstrate how you can leverage automated tools, clearly documented code standards and a well-defined development process in order to make building and testing accessible React apps a breeze. I will discuss the ways that I automate certain aspects of my development workflows to catch accessibility errors, define and set up tests and go through the entire lifecycle of accessibility feature development using a real-world example.</p>

Working in a silo, not physically surrounded by teammates can make morale and code suffer. I was fortunate to be on a team that found ways to not only make us feel united in building projects together but also as a team of people who could laugh, commiserate, and be open with each other. In this talk Iâll cover the techniques and tools teams have found that strengthen team bonds and morale while keeping up productivity and collaborative project work.</p>

                        <p>If youâve worked with the React useState hook before, you might have wondered why global state management canât be just as easy. Why do we still need so much boilerplate to manage state with the Context API? What if we donât want to be constrained by opinionated tools like Redux Toolkit or forced to use actions and reducers in our React applications? This is where Hookstate comes in. Hookstate is not just another state management solution. Apart from being feature-rich, fast, and flexible, the library takes the idea of simplifying state management in React apps to a whole new level. In this talk, Iâll introduce Hookstate as a simple and efficient state management solution for React applications.</p>

                      <p>Have you ever wanted to refactor mercilessly but didn't want to break the fragile tower? Or have you ever pushed to production only to spend the next few days cleaning up the regressions? You need end-to-end tests, and Cypress is a great, fast way to build them. With a simple JavaScript or TypeScript interface, you can automate browsers to hit those critical functions in your app to prove it works as expected -- this time and every time. Join us to dive into building Cypress tests and leave with confidence to refactor your way to greatness.</p>

                      <p>Frontend applications are getting more and more complicated, often delivering far more than just a UI. With this growing complexity comes a growing need for knowledge from the developers creating it, as they have to deal with matters like state-management, authorization, routing and more. In this talk, I'll show you how to use GraphQL in your Next.js application to create a data layer for your application, that exists between your frontend and your backend. In this data layer, you can handle complex matters to help you to keep your frontend application clean and "stupid".</p>
