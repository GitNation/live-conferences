            "description": "<p>All the React you've seen is presented one way: as a linear text file. There's good reason for this. Textual syntax is an ideal medium for constructing abstract logic. It's quick to write, informationally dense, and endlessly flexible. However, brevity has its downsides. What information can't we see in static text?

But what if new entries are being added or updated at a rate of hundreds per second? And what if the user should be able to filter and sort them freely? How can we stay responsive in such scenarios? In this talk we discuss how Flipper introduced map-reduce inspired FSRW transformations to handle such scenarios gracefully. By applying the techniques introduced in this talk Flipper frame rates increased at least 10-fold and we hope to open source this approach soon.</p>\n",

            "description": "<p>There are some great libraries that help with i18n in React, but surprisingly little guidance on how to handle i18n end-to-end.  This talk will discuss best practices and practical advice for handling translations in React.  We will discuss how to extract strings from your code, how to manage translation files, how to think about long-term maintenance of your translations, and even avoiding common pitfalls where single-language developers tend to get stuck.</p>\n",

In this talk, we’ll see how data viz development can get so much easier thanks to tools like Plot, a high-level dataviz library for quick &#x26; easy charting, and Observable, a reactive dataviz prototyping environment, both from the creator of D3. Through live coding examples we’ll explore how React refs let us delegate DOM manipulation for our data visualizations, and how Observable’s embedding functionality lets us easily repurpose community-built visualizations for our own data &#x26; use cases. By the end of this talk we’ll know how to get a beautiful, customized, interactive data visualization into our apps with a fraction of the time &#x26; effort!</p>\n",

                "description": "There is generally a good understanding on how to render large (say, 100K items) datasets using virtual lists, …if they remain largely static. But what if new entries are being added or updated at a rate of hundreds per second? And what if the user should be able to filter and sort them freely? How can we stay responsive in such scenarios? In this talk we discuss how Flipper introduced map-reduce inspired FSRW transformations to handle such scenarios gracefully. By applying the techniques introduced in this talk Flipper frame rates increased at least 10-fold and we hope to open source this approach soon.",

In this talk, we’ll see how data viz development can get so much easier thanks to tools like Plot, a high-level dataviz library for quick & easy charting, and Observable, a reactive dataviz prototyping environment, both from the creator of D3. Through live coding examples we’ll explore how React refs let us delegate DOM manipulation for our data visualizations, and how Observable’s embedding functionality lets us easily repurpose community-built visualizations for our own data & use cases. By the end of this talk we’ll know how to get a beautiful, customized, interactive data visualization into our apps with a fraction of the time & effort!",

Add this to its new suspense SSR capabilities, and we get an paradigm shift in the world of client/server side rendering. A new era of web development. In this talk we'll deep dive into this interesting and experimental feature, understand what it solves, how to (not over-)use it, talk about the state of the art practices regarding server rendering, and maybe get a glimpse into the exciting future of front-back-full-stack relationships.",

              <h3>Preventive Measures at the Conference</h3>
              <p>Of course, it's important for us to stay cautious and make the environment safe for everyone, so the in-person event will offer all the safety measures in accordance with the local regulations. The specifics are not yet clear, and we should know more in late summer. However, we are ready to take the following measures at the in-person part of the event, should they be required by the authorities: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Proof of vaccination or recent negative test will be checked upon entry to the venue</li>
                <li>Temperature checks will be performed during registration</li>
                <li>Wearing face masks will be advisable in the closed spaces of the venue</li>
                <li>Sanitizer dispenser stations will be available inside the venue</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Our team will ensure that the measures are as efficient and unobtrusive as possible. </p>
              <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
              <p>We understand that along the way, there might be obstacles for some attendees. We offer refunds in the following cases: </p>
              <ol>
                <li>You can no longer enter the United Kingdom due to covid-related policy changes</li>
                <li>The in-person part get canceled due to covid-related policy changes</li>
              </ol>
              <p>Any attendee with a valid in-person ticket will be refunded the price difference between the in-person and the full-access remote ticket, so that they can take part in the event online. </p>
              <p>Alternatively, the in-person ticket can be swapped for a full-access remote ticket and an annual <a href="https://gitnation.org/multipass-subscription">GitNation Multipass</a>, providing access to 7 additional remote events and tens of talk &#x26; workshop recordings from our past conferences. </p>
              <p>When requesting a refund, please contact us via the following <a href="https://forms.gle/Hs9ZGqiRtxWiPVho9">form</a>.</p>
