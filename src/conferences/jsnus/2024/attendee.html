                "description": "<p>When was the last time you peeked inside the dist folder to inspect the JavaScript generated by your framework or bundler?</p><p><br /></p><p>The reality of modern JavaScript development with it's reliance of bundlers, frameworks and compilers is that the JavaScript you write is not the same as the JavaScript that runs on your browser. Tools like TypeScript and compilers like Babel allow you to support a variety of older browsers, environments, and runtimes while writing modern, maintainable code, but it can be hard to tell what is going on in that final bundle. It's crucial to understand and optimize the generated JavaScript produced during your build process so that you maximize performance.</p><p><br /></p><p>Join Abhijeet Prasad, maintainer of Sentry's open source error and performance monitoring JavaScript SDKs as he walks through the performance and bundle size implications of generated JavaScript and techniques you can use to optimize it. He'll walk through transpilation nuances, tree-shaking, minification, and loading strategies so you can understand how to deliver better experiences for your users.</p>\n",

We will be following an implementation of a virtual scrolling viewport using web components from start to finish, including variable element heights, skeletons, asynchronous child component rendering. We will then optimize it using memoization, wrapping more-performant imperative constructs in a functional layer, and using element recycling to significantly reduce render churn when using stateless child components.<br /><br />Finally, we will touch on the state of the art in virtual DOM rendering, and how this approach compares to the use of the new `content-visibility` CSS property.</p>\n",

                "description": "<p>Two aspects of resolvers have an outsized influence on their performance: the size of the execution context, and the way we compute their value. In the Node.js implementation of graphql, promises wrapping primitive values are especially disruptive, since they add a large computing overhead. The context size creates a memory usage baseline that can rise very quickly with even small additions to the context, when there are many concurrent contexts. The execution can create temporary objects, increasing memory usage. Often-run resolvers, such as those responsible for filling out large arrays of objects, can become performance bottlenecks.<br /><br />At Auction.com, our search results page (SRP) requests up to 500 items of roughly 80 fields each. The query resolving these fields was suffering a high latency. We shall examine the tools to instrument our code and identify memory usage and CPU utilization bottlenecks.<br /><br />Our realtime elements (e.g. realtime updates to the status of currently viewed properties) are implemented using a translation of ¬†kafka messages to graphql updates. We shall present the tools and procedures to reduce memory usage and CPU usage when fanning out such messages.</p>\n",

In its development, we have rewritten esbuild &amp; rollup in rust, taken apart parcel to understand it better, and overall have reviewed every bundler on the market during the development of rspack before finally picking the webpack api design for the project as it is known today.In this talk I will share the behind the scenes of its creation, why we built it, what the future for rspack looks like, and our own experience + business data we have gathered with it in supermassive projects at ByteDance.",

In the Node.js implementation of graphql, promises wrapping primitive values are especially disruptive, since they add a large computing overhead. The context size creates a memory usage baseline that can rise very quickly with even small additions to the context, when there are many concurrent contexts. The execution can create temporary objects, increasing memory usage.

I've painfully realised that some of the tools and conventions we take for granted make things much more difficult than they feel they \"should\" be. We spend most of our time doing stuff over and over again that doesn't really feel related to each individual app (persistence, permissions, shared state). But four years ago, I found out about a new abstraction (CRDTs) and a co-discovered a new way of building apps (local-first). Ever since I've been trying to wrap up this alien new tech in a familiar, ergonomic interface.",
