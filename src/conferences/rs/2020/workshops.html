                    <p>In our experience, if you are using promises, you are likely using them wrong (and nearly everybody else is too). This is most often due to misunderstandings about how Promises work, choices that were made by TC39 when designing the promises API, inconsistencies in how Promises are used, or failure to account for the cost of using Promises in an application, and ultimately how the event loop works. In this workshop, we aim to help developers do the right thing with Promises. Through a series of hands on exercises and puzzles, developers will learn the ins and outs of developing with Promises in Node.js, learning everything they should do, and most importantly what they shouldn't do, in order to maximize the effectiveness of their code and avoid common performance pitfalls.</p>

While design systems encompass tools and processes for everyone in the company, we will focus on the code side of it - Platform agnostic design tokens and a component library in React that can be used in products and can evolve as teams use it.</p>

                    <p>In this full day workshop we will go through the process of creating Whatsapp app in React Native from scratch. We will talk about how to get started, structure our app and create proper navigation workflow, style our screens and create compelling animations. But we will not stop there. Not only React Native is changing mobile ecosystem nowadays, GraphQL is also an important part of how we connect to our backend.</p>
                    <p>We will go through GraphQL basics and use it in our Whatsapp app to connect to GraphQL endpoint which we will also define and create during workshop by using free and open source Hasura GraphQL engine. Workshop will give you the ultimate experience of creating React Native app from scratch with GraphQL API.</p>

                    <p>In this workshop, you’ll learn how to use AWS Amplify and React to build a full-stack cloud application using serverless technologies. The app will incorporate features like routing, authentication, authorization, a GraphQL database, and image storage. You’ll learn how to then deploy the app to a global CDN using Amplify hosting. By the end of the workshop, you should have a good understanding of how to build full-stack serverless applications leveraging your existing skillset as a front-end developer.</p>

                    <p>More and more projects are using TypeScript. This workshop will provide a deep dive into the language, and basic TypeScript knowledge is assumed. We will briefly discuss the design philosophy of TypeScript, and then cover all the lesser-known or harder features. That is: do all the cool and weird meta programming stuff (TS is turing complete!) and learn the tricks you won't find in the handbook.</p>
                    <p>So join if you feel like you're writing too much type annotations to make TypeScript happy! We'll dive deep into how type inference and control flows works, and how you can make the compiler work for you. We'll discuss all the fancier language constructs like:</p>

                    <p>React keeps innovating and bringing new and better features. Despite this constant change, the principles of React remain the same: composition, immutability, purity... in other words, functional programming principles. In this advanced workshop, you will learn how to implement advanced features in React applying functional programming in JavaScript without using any other libraries.</p>

                    <p>MobX is now five years old and still one of the most popular state management solutions in React (used by for example Microsoft Outlook, the Battlefield games, Amazon and Netflix). With the (almost) recently released version 6 MobX has been modernized and is more accessible than ever. </p>
                    <p>In this brand new workshop we will discuss the philosophy of MobX, and cover all the basics of building a MobX managed application, using observables, Context and hooks. We will also discuss how MobX works behind the scenes and why MobX applications typically don't need any further manual optimizations. Basic JavaScript and React knowledge is required for this workshop. </p>

                    <p>This one-day workshop will teach you everything you need to know to incorporate GraphQL into your application. During the first half of the workshop, we'll explain the basics of a GraphQL and we’re gonna build a GraphQL server, covering best practices for architecting your schema, error handling, authentication, and permission layers. In the second half of the workshop, we’ll connect our GraphQL server to a React application with Apollo Client. We’ll break down the modular architecture of the client and teach you how to set everything up and use queries and mutations. We’ll show a few different approaches for working with Apollo: Higher Order Components, Render Props, and hooks. Throughout the course of the workshop, you’ll learn practical tips for using GraphQL in production.</p>

                    <p>React is fast, until it isn't</p>
                    <p>In this workshop, you'll learn everything you need to diagnose, profile, and fix performance problems in your React application using the Browser Performance Profiler, React DevTools Profiler, and proven React optimization techniques.</p>
                    <p>The tools we have for profiling React Applications are extremely powerful, but they can often be really difficult to grok. Sure, starting a profiling session is simple enough, but how do you go from all the information in the flamegraph to actionable steps to improve your application's performance? And once you know what parts of your app are causing performance issues, what then? How do you optimize your React components without making the whole application a complex mess?</p>
                    <p>Oh, and don't forget that you should profile your app in production mode to make sure you get accurate measurements. Do you know how to do that?</p>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Kent C. Dodds and in my latest workshop I'll teach you the ins and outs of optimizing React applications. I will take you on a deep dive browser profiling tools, and show you what you need to know to start using them to make your applications fast right away.</p>

                    <p>More and more projects are using TypeScript. This workshop will provide a deep dive into the language, and basic TypeScript knowledge is assumed. We will briefly discuss the design philosophy of TypeScript, and then cover all the lesser-known or harder features. That is: do all the cool and weird meta programming stuff (TS is turing complete!) and learn the tricks you won't find in the handbook.</p>
                    <p>So join if you feel like you're writing too much type annotations to make TypeScript happy! We'll dive deep into how type inference and control flows works, and how you can make the compiler work for you. We'll discuss all the fancier language constructs like:</p>

                    <p>Use jest, jest-dom, and React Testing Library to write unit and integration tests for React Components Writing React applications is pretty easy, but shipping those applications with confidence is an entirely different story. How do you know that your changes work? How do you know those changes aren’t going to break other parts of your application? Do you have to manually walk through your whole application to make certain everything’s still working? No thank you! The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. Let’s learn how to write tests that make us confident.</p>
                    <p>In this hands-on workshop we’ll work on adding tests to existing components as well as use our tests to speed up our workflow building new components. We’ll work with everything from simple components and JavaScript functions to complex components with asynchronous logic.</p>

                    <p>styled-components has taken over the React world. Some of the biggest websites on the planet like wish.com, spotify.com, imdb.com, patreon.com and many more are styled using it. By the end of this workshop, you’ll have built your own simple version of styled-components. You’ll master CSS-in-JS and how it works, understand the tradeoffs of design decisions behind all major CSS-in-JS libraries and maybe even grasp how to make API decisions for your own open source projects (whether about CSS or not).</p>
