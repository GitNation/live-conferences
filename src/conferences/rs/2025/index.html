										"description": "<p>AI-powered development tools are excellent for helping us deliver code more quickly. However, based on my extensive experience in test automation and identity management, I've noticed that these tools can also introduce subtle security issues that might even impress Skynet.</p><p><br /></p><p>In this session, I will discuss real-world examples where AI assistants have inadvertently worked against developers, highlighting cases of data leaks, supply chain attacks, and prompt injection vulnerabilities. You will learn effective strategies to identify AI-generated security issues before they impact you. After all, if Skynet ever awakens, let's ensure it isn't due to an untested AI-generated function that set it off.</p>\n",

Full stack frameworks like Next and Remix give you full control over the web experience with access to a dedicated web server.

Without a structured approach, permissions quickly become a tangled mess of if-else statements, leading to poor maintainability and scalability. While Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provides a strong starting point for managing user access, it may not offer the level of granularity needed as your app evolves. To gain finer control over who can perform what actions, on which objects, and under what conditions, the Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model, recommended by OWASP, becomes invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this session, we’ll explore two practical approaches to building a scalable permissions system in React. First, I&#39;ll introduce CASL, a popular ABAC library that simplifies fine-grained access control.

Without a structured approach, permissions quickly become a tangled mess of if-else statements, leading to poor maintainability and scalability. While Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provides a strong starting point for managing user access, it may not offer the level of granularity needed as your app evolves. To gain finer control over who can perform what actions, on which objects, and under what conditions, the Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) model, recommended by OWASP, becomes invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this session, we’ll explore two practical approaches to building a scalable permissions system in React. First, I&#39;ll introduce CASL, a popular ABAC library that simplifies fine-grained access control.

That means snappy interactions, minimal layout shifts, and avoiding unnecessary loading spinners wherever we can.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, we&#39;ll dive into advanced techniques like various forms of prefetching (including integration with route loaders), seeding the query cache, crafting smooth paginated experiences, and even persisting query state through full page reloads using persistence plugins.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Note: You should have prior knowledge about React Query if you attend this workshop.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;June 11, 09:00 - 13:00 CET.

A large number of web and JS applications now leverage large language models (LLMs), vector search / RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for building better user experiences. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now the tide is shifting, and we have entered the era of AI agents. This is a promising field which combines the different generative AI usecases and helps to simplify the process of interacting with Gen AI by essentially making agents act like humans and makes interactions feel more human like to solve problems in an automated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, while we give a quick over view of LLMs, RAG, we will dive deeper into concepts of AI Agents such has how one can leverage LLMs for specific tasks. How can we include tool calling / function calling in AI Agents. Thus showing how an AI Agent is a system that is capable of independently deciding which functions or data sources to used to efficiently execute users&#39; orders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We will show how to develop an AI agent that runs purely on the browser vs running them using cloud.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This workshop is for javaScript developers, AI enthusiasts, and tech innovators who want to integrate the use of AI within web applications to create intelligent and interactive app experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Table of contents:&lt;br&gt;\n1.

Tests passed. CI’s green. Everything’s deployed. Life’s good… until the alerts start rolling in. Users reporting “weird stuff happening”, UI glitches, vague “it seems slow” reports, and that dreaded “can’t login” message. Well, this is shaping up to be a bad day. But… maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch this hands-on session to learn how to build it, break it, debug it, and go from “no idea what’s wrong” to fixing issues—all in one go. Since we’re serious developers (obviously), we’ll use Next.js and:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Setup Sentry from the ground up - including Errors, Session Replay, and Tracing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn ways to use Replays to understand the real user experience, and how to use Tracing to debug application issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage Sentry AI and the context of your application to understand what’s actually broken, and use Autofix to generate a fix - from root cause all the way to PR.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use this workshop guide to follow along: &lt;a href=\&quot;https://sentry-build.vercel.app/quickstart/\&quot; target=\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Quickstart Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;startDate&quot;:&quot;2025-06-02T14:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;endDate&quot;:&quot;2025-06-02T17:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;workshopExtensions&quot;:[{&quot;includedToPackage&quot;:true,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;June 2, 16:00-19:00 CET.

How to make it scary free to deliver your work results? How to battle bugs that are chasing you at every step you make?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am going to answer these questions during the workshop and show how to follow TDD at React applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To showcase the approach I am going to use Cypress, React, MobX, and even Dev Containers. These tools can be replaced by others that are in use in your projects today. Here and now tooling is not so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In spite of the title the workshop is going to be useful not only for frontend developers. You can benefit from it even working in a different area of development because the key here is a mindset of how to make reliable applications through testing.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;startDate&quot;:&quot;2025-06-03T14:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;endDate&quot;:&quot;2025-06-03T16:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;workshopExtensions&quot;:[{&quot;includedToPackage&quot;:true,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;June 3, 16:00-18:00 CET.

In this interactive 3-hour workshop, you’ll learn how to create engaging diagram UIs using React and the popular React Flow library. We’ll start by exploring key libraries for creating custom diagram UIs, comparing their strengths, differences, and most effective use cases. Focusing on React Flow, we’ll then build a workflow application together, introducing features such as custom nodes and edges, drag-and-drop functionality, state management, minimap and zoom controls, auto- layout, and property-editing sidebar. You’ll discover how to leverage open-source UI components designed for diagramming to enhance visual appeal and learn how to extend diagrams with custom functionality. We’ll also look at existing tools and products that can streamline your development process – so you can concentrate on implementing your business logic efficiently. By the end of this workshop, you’ll know how to unlock the potential of node-based UIs in React, enabling you to create rich, interactive applications tailored precisely to your project’s needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workshop Agenda:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction to Diagram Libraries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building a Workflow Application with React Flow&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Implementing Advanced Interaction and Usability Features&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enhancing the User Experience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Extending and Scaling Your Node-based UI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please note that this workshop assumes a comfortable working knowledge of React, so we can focus on building advanced features right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;startDate&quot;:&quot;2025-06-09T14:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;endDate&quot;:&quot;2025-06-09T17:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;workshopExtensions&quot;:[{&quot;includedToPackage&quot;:true,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;June 9, 16:00-19:00 CET.

									<p>We’re looking specifically at open source projects or initiatives, with or without a code, but following an open and transparent culture, open for collaboration and contributions from any person interested. </p>
									<p>Github stars are not our criteria, and we’re looking for hidden gems (non yet maintstream), that may not have enough marketing power or huge companies behind them. The main goal of the project is to shed some light on great projects, that weren’t enough noticed in a competitive environment and hype. </p>
