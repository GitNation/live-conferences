That’s why focusing on iteration velocity is so important and you should design your application architecture accordingly. Full stack frameworks like Next and Remix give you full control over the web experience with access to a dedicated web server.

But what if you need to add another frontend to your project?

You&#39;ll gain fresh perspectives on building systems that last and learn why the best architectures are more about enabling people than enforcing technical decisions.

This talk delves into the innovative use of speculation rules to enhance web loading times and overall performance. Attendees will gain insights into the principles and mechanisms behind speculation rules, learn how they predict and pre-fetch resources, and explore real-world applications and case studies demonstrating their impact.

In this practical, experience-driven talk, I'll take you through our two-year journey of building and scaling a JavaScript application from ground zero. Rather than theoretical concepts, you'll hear real stories about the technical challenges we faced and the solutions we implemented.</div>

I&#39;ve served as CTO of an ed-tech venture and have led several teams over the years to build scalable production-grade React and React Native products.

As someone who enjoys building nifty little tools and snippets that make my (and other people&#39;s) lives easier, I&#39;m always thinking about my next big project and how much simpler it&#39;ll make my day. I&#39;ve served as CTO of an ed-tech venture and have led several teams over the years to build scalable production-grade React and React Native products. I also enjoy actively participating in UX decisions and aim to build products that are intuitively effortless to use.\n&quot;,&quot;githubUrl&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/menahishayan&quot;,&quot;twitterUrl&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/MenahiShayan&quot;,&quot;portalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/shayan_136926&quot;,&quot;ownSite&quot;:&quot;https://menahishayan.com&quot;,&quot;socials&quot;:[{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/menahishayan&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;gh&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/shayan_136926&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;portal&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/MenahiShayan&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;tw&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://menahishayan.com&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;site&quot;}]},{&quot;id&quot;:137241,&quot;website&quot;:&quot;https://www.austinshelby.com/&quot;,&quot;github&quot;:&quot;AustinShelby&quot;,&quot;twitter&quot;:&quot;theAustinShelby&quot;,&quot;linkedin&quot;:&quot;austin-shelby&quot;,&quot;instagram&quot;:null,&quot;tiktok&quot;:null,&quot;avatar&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.imgix.net/stichting-frontend-amsterdam/image/upload/v1738797848/6yO4HS9vJ%402FT5PoaajcefUKIOSaVrTmyDGQqOs9ljICc%403D.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=300&amp;h=300&quot;,&quot;shortBio&quot;:null,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;Freelance software engineer&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Finland, Helsinki&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Austin Shelby&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;austin_shelby&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;I am a freelance software engineer, instructor, and public speaker with over half a decade of hands-on experience in the entire software development process.&quot;,&quot;githubUrl&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/AustinShelby&quot;,&quot;twitterUrl&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/theAustinShelby&quot;,&quot;portalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/austin_shelby&quot;,&quot;ownSite&quot;:&quot;https://austinshelby.com&quot;,&quot;socials&quot;:[{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/AustinShelby&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;gh&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/austin_shelby&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;portal&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/theAustinShelby&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;tw&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://austinshelby.com&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;site&quot;}]},{&quot;id&quot;:137860,&quot;website&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;github&quot;:&quot;nepshaaa&quot;,&quot;twitter&quot;:&quot;nepshaaa&quot;,&quot;linkedin&quot;:&quot;nepshaaa&quot;,&quot;instagram&quot;:null,&quot;tiktok&quot;:null,&quot;avatar&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.imgix.net/stichting-frontend-amsterdam/image/upload/v1740465732/g0MZ0WsRA1uNdxSwTkyMe2N1HvKifbmQhMJjQJ%402FgD4k%403D.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=300&amp;h=300&quot;,&quot;shortBio&quot;:null,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Russia, Moscow&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Anton Nepsha&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;nepshaaa&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Lead Frontend Developer at Sber, 11 years of making online banking web-apps and contributing to internal frontend community.\n&quot;,&quot;githubUrl&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/nepshaaa&quot;,&quot;twitterUrl&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/nepshaaa&quot;,&quot;portalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/nepshaaa&quot;,&quot;ownSite&quot;:null,&quot;socials&quot;:[{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/nepshaaa&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;gh&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/nepshaaa&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;portal&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/nepshaaa&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;tw&quot;}]},{&quot;id&quot;:138622,&quot;website&quot;:&quot;@queen_shecoder&quot;,&quot;github&quot;:&quot;sheC0der&quot;,&quot;twitter&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;linkedin&quot;:&quot;innocencia-ndembera&quot;,&quot;instagram&quot;:null,&quot;tiktok&quot;:null,&quot;avatar&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.imgix.net/stichting-frontend-amsterdam/image/upload/v1741708271/Inno_headshot_mg72wv.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=300&amp;h=300&quot;,&quot;shortBio&quot;:null,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;Chip In Limited as Co-Founder and COO &quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Malawi&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Innocencia Ndembera&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;innocencia_ndembera&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Innocencia Ndembera is the Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of Chip In Limited, a forward-thinking software engineering company committed to revolutionizing agriculture and financial inclusion in Malawi.
