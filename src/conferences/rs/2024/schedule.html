While there, my Creative Director warned me to never let anyone find out I could code, because if I did I'd be stuck doing it forever. I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.",

While there, my Creative Director warned me to never let anyone find out I could code, because if I did I'd be stuck doing it forever. I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.",

From the TypeScript language to type description utilities such as prop-types and Zod, developers expect clear descriptions of the shapes of their React components, data, and hooks. Let&#39;s talk about the mindset shift that&#39;s happened over the last decade, and where types are taking us over the next one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brief foundations: what is TypeScript, what \&quot;type safety\&quot; means, and setting up TypeScript in a React (Next.js) projectA history of how type safety has worked in React, starting with class components&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking in Type(s|Script): How modeling value shapes helps raise predictability and understandability, especially in the wildest and wackiest of React architectures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TypeScript&#39;s Limitations: By design, TypeScript can only act as a development-time type system and enforce what that system can represent. We&#39;ll want to go over what can&#39;t and/or shouldn&#39;t be represented in that type system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raising the Runtime: Moving those type thoughts into your React runtime with programmatic frameworks or libraries such as tRPC and Zod - especially as they integrate with React metaframeworks like Next.js and Remix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;React Specifics: How this \&quot;types-first\&quot; theory works helps improve common parts of projects in the React ecosystem: from prop-types back in the day to REST or RPC endpoints, testing, and documentation today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ESLint lint rules to catch common async and React code bugs - and why the language is designed to let you do those dangerous things in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecosystem future: where the TC39 types-as-comments proposal will -and won&#39;t- take types at a language-level for JavaScript in general and React apps specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By allowing our types to be a reflection of the runtime reality, we embrace types-first thinking in designing code - making our code more clear to read and update. These better-define boundaries help in everything from better-defined React component boundaries to auto-generated client&amp;lt;&amp;gt;server API bridges. Hooray, types!&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;typescript&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Summit Track&quot;},&quot;timeString&quot;:&quot;2024-06-14T12:55:00.000Z&quot;}]}} });

As a React developer, it is a good chance to grow and expand. Many React developers might wonder: “What do I need to know about AI? and do I have what it takes?” With AI reshaping industries, the pressure to adapt and expand our skillisets is palpable. The question isn’t just about staying relevant; it’s about seizing unprecedented opportunities in development and automation. What if learning AI could help you do more with React? Think about using AI to help with coding, or to make smarter apps faster. This talk will show you how to start. in this talk, we’ll demystify the role of an AI engineer and outline the essential skills React developers need to transition into this evolving field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;best practices&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Summit Track&quot;},&quot;timeString&quot;:&quot;2024-06-18T14:40:00.000Z&quot;}]}} });

In this talk we will discuss in more details the obstacles we faced and the innovative solutions we implemented to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;dayISO&quot;:&quot;2024-06-18T00:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:&quot;Summit Track&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;next-js-reshaping-web-app-architecture-for-performance-excellence&quot;,&quot;isLightning&quot;:true,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;next.js&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;talk--undefined&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:[{&quot;label&quot;:&quot;next.js&quot;,&quot;colour&quot;:null},{&quot;label&quot;:&quot;performance&quot;,&quot;colour&quot;:null}],&quot;speakers&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:99760,&quot;website&quot;:null,&quot;github&quot;:null,&quot;twitter&quot;:null,&quot;linkedin&quot;:&quot;mia-nasr-khneisser&quot;,&quot;instagram&quot;:null,&quot;tiktok&quot;:null,&quot;avatar&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.imgix.net/stichting-frontend-amsterdam/image/upload/v1711712182/Mia-react-summit_edvgs3.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=300&amp;h=300&quot;,&quot;shortBio&quot;:&quot;Lead full-stack developer at l’Oréal, leveraging 6 years of expertise.&quot;,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;l’Oréal&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;France&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Mia NASR KHNEISSER&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;mia_nasr_khneisser&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;I am a lead full-stack developer at l’Oréal, leveraging 6 years of expertise.

He spends a lot of time thinking about the experience for Pages&#39; developers, but also (and maybe more importantly) the experience for their end-users. How can applications, frameworks, and platforms all work together to produce the most performant, most accessible, and most delightful experience for users, regardless of where they are, what device they&#39;re using, or what internet connection they have.  &quot;,&quot;githubUrl&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/GregBrimble&quot;,&quot;twitterUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/GregBrimble&quot;,&quot;portalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/greg_brimble&quot;,&quot;ownSite&quot;:&quot;https://gregbrimble.com&quot;,&quot;socials&quot;:[{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/GregBrimble&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;gh&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/greg_brimble&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;portal&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/GregBrimble&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;tw&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://gregbrimble.com&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;site&quot;}]}],&quot;activities&quot;:{&quot;talks&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;AsyncLocalStorage vs. React Context&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;AsyncLocalStorage is a modern API which has landed in many JavaScript runtimes.

While there, my Creative Director warned me to never let anyone find out I could code, because if I did I&#39;d be stuck doing it forever. I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I&#39;ve never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.&quot;,&quot;githubUrl&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/kathryngraysonnanz&quot;,&quot;twitterUrl&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/kathryngrayson&quot;,&quot;portalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/kathryn_grayson_nanz&quot;,&quot;ownSite&quot;:&quot;https://kgrayson.com&quot;,&quot;socials&quot;:[{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/kathryngraysonnanz&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;gh&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/kathryn_grayson_nanz&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;portal&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/kathryngrayson&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;tw&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://kgrayson.com&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;site&quot;}]}],&quot;subactivities&quot;:[]} });
