While there, my Creative Director warned me to never let anyone find out I could code, because if I did I'd be stuck doing it forever. I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.",

While there, my Creative Director warned me to never let anyone find out I could code, because if I did I'd be stuck doing it forever. I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.",

                  <h3>Building your own Custom Type System </h3>
                  <p>I'll introduce the audience to a concept where they can have end-to-end type systems that helps ensure typesafety across the teams Such a system not only improves communication between teams but also helps teams collaborate effectively and ship way faster than they used to before. By having a custom type system, teams can also identify the errors and modify the API contracts on their IDE, which contributes to a better Developer Experience. The workshop would primarily leverage TS to showcase the concept and use tools like OpenAPI to generate the typesystem on the client side. </p>

                  <h3>Hands-On AI: Integrating LangChain with JavaScript for Web Developers</h3>
                  <p>Dive into the world of AI with our interactive workshop designed specifically for web developers. "Hands-On AI: Integrating LangChain with JavaScript for Web Developers" offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between AI and web development. Despite the prominence of Python in AI development, the vast potential of JavaScript remains largely untapped. This workshop aims to change that.</p>
                  <p>Throughout this hands-on session, participants will learn how to leverage LangChain—a tool designed to make large language models more accessible and useful—to build dynamic AI agents directly within JavaScript environments. This approach opens up new possibilities for enhancing web applications with intelligent features, from automated customer support to content generation and beyond.</p>
                  <p>We'll start with the basics of LangChain and AI models, ensuring a solid foundation even for those new to AI. From there, we'll dive into practical exercises that demonstrate how to integrate these technologies into real-world JavaScript projects. Participants will work through examples, facing and overcoming the challenges of making AI work seamlessly on the web.</p>
                  <p>This workshop is more than just a learning experience; it's a chance to be at the forefront of an emerging field. By the end, attendees will not only have gained valuable skills but also created AI-enhanced features they can take back to their projects or workplaces.</p>
                  <p>Whether you're a seasoned web developer curious about AI or looking to expand your skillset into new and exciting areas, "Hands-On AI: Integrating LangChain with JavaScript for Web Developers" is your gateway to the future of web development. Join us to unlock the potential of AI in your web projects, making them smarter, more interactive, and more engaging for users.</p>

                  <h3>LLMs Workshop: What they are and how to leverage them</h3>
                  <p>Join Nathan and Haris in this hands-on session where you will first learn at a high level what large language models (LLMs) are and how they work. Then dive into an interactive coding exercise where you will implement LLM functionality into a basic example application. During this exercise, you will get a feel for key skills for working with LLMs in your own applications such as prompt engineering and exposure to OpenAI's API.</p>
                  <p>After this session, you will have insights around what LLMs are and how they can practically be used to improve your own applications.</p>
