I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.",

While there, my Creative Director warned me to never let anyone find out I could code, because if I did I'd be stuck doing it forever. I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.",

Prior to the release of CRA, the experience of setting up a React app was more about configuring webpack than it was actually writing React code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that the React docs no longer list CRA as a suggestion on the “Start a New React Project” page, and additionally recommend you pick a React-powered framework, the getting started experience is once again fragmented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRA was never meant to be how you built a full-featured React app anyway. It was a starting point, and a really good one. Inevitably many developers (such as myself) used CRA to build websites, and lots of them. However, a lot more goes into building a website than just using a “library for web and native user interfaces” — you need to handle routing, data fetching and mutations, styling, and a whole lot more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe Remix is the best framework available for taking up this mantle.

I’ll show you how ignoring React’s best practices can improve performance, all without major rewrites to your codebase. To understand how, we’ll learn when React decides to render and how to trick it to render less frequently. We’ll build components that don’t render anything, conditionally call hooks, and even use a piece of Svelte - all to quickly fix real performance problems I encountered at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;react&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:0,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;the-art-of-ignoring-best-practices-for-react-performance&quot;}],&quot;offlineTalks&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:2124,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;The Art of Ignoring Best Practices for React Performance&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted to break the rules and be a React troublemaker?

But do you really know TypeScript? Join Josh Goldberg, author of Learning TypeScript (O’Reilly) in a deep dive into your favorite strongly typed flavor of JavaScript. We’ll learn how to really use the type system to your advantage to help write readable, type-safe, TypeScript code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This interactive workshop will build up your TypeScript mastery through the following sections:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Structural typing: Recapping how the type system fundamentally works with inferred vs. explicit object types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using IDE features: Code navigation, name completions, and error debugging that level up any JavaScript and/or TypeScript developer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shape satisfaction: Showing different ways to create objects that partially or completely adhere to shapes, including with the new &lt;code&gt;satisfies&lt;/code&gt; keyword&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Type modifiers: Using the &lt;code&gt;keyof&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; type-system-only keywords to infer types from values or other types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generics: Using type parameters, especially in conjunction with &lt;code&gt;keyof&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt;, to introduce reusability into the type system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mapped types: Transforming existing types into new ones for flexibility and reusability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conditional types: Introducing logic into the type system for some truly dynamic types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Miscellaneous: You tell me! We’ll spend the rest of the day covering any questions you have.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout the workshop, we’ll be building up a small version of the popular “Zod” library that can define and validate schemas along with their types. You’ll emerge with a working mini-Zod and a renewed appreciation for the inference libraries like it provide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each session consists of a ~30-45 minute interactive lecture+workshop, with 15 minutes in-between for bio breaks and miscellaneous questions, and a lunch break in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;Intermediate/advanced.&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: June 12, 9:00-18:00 CEST.

Everyone is. While React has not yet officially released server components and actions as features in a stable version of React, you want to understand how these features work because you’d like to use them within one of the frameworks built on top of React which has support for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this workshop we won’t be using any frameworks. In fact you might say we’ll be building our own framework. It’s important for you to understand at least one or two layers below where you typically operate to be able to use your abstractions effectively. So we’ll be working with the raw/unreleased/experimental/futuristic APIs for React Server Components and React Server Actions.\nOnce you finish this workshop, you’ll finally have the proper mental model for what server components and actions will do for you as an every day React app developer. Whatever kind of React app you’re building (and whatever architecture you have), you’ll find ways to apply these future features to your application eventually and after this workshop you’ll be eager to do so for the DX and UX improvements they provide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;The relationship between client and server components and their respective module graphs&quot;,&quot;Streaming serialized React elements&quot;,&quot;Submitting forms to server actions&quot;,&quot;Managing pending state for server actions&quot;,&quot;Providing great loading UX with optimistic UI&quot;],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: June 19-20, 16:00-20:00 CEST.

Despite the prominence of Python in AI development, the vast potential of JavaScript remains largely untapped. This workshop aims to change that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout this hands-on session, participants will learn how to leverage LangChain—a tool designed to make large language models more accessible and useful—to build dynamic AI agents directly within JavaScript environments. This approach opens up new possibilities for enhancing web applications with intelligent features, from automated customer support to content generation and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll start with the basics of LangChain and AI models, ensuring a solid foundation even for those new to AI. From there, we&#39;ll dive into practical exercises that demonstrate how to integrate these technologies into real-world JavaScript projects. Participants will work through examples, facing and overcoming the challenges of making AI work seamlessly on the web.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This workshop is more than just a learning experience; it&#39;s a chance to be at the forefront of an emerging field. By the end, attendees will not only have gained valuable skills but also created AI-enhanced features they can take back to their projects or workplaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re a seasoned web developer curious about AI or looking to expand your skillset into new and exciting areas, \&quot;Hands-On AI: Integrating LangChain with JavaScript for Web Developers\&quot; is your gateway to the future of web development. Join us to unlock the potential of AI in your web projects, making them smarter, more interactive, and more engaging for users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: June 26, 16:00-18:00 CEST.
