However, when it comes to complex UIs, it is not rare to encounter scenarios where state management between micro frontends is necessary. This talk is about finding the sweet spot — In which scenarios it is reasonable for micro frontends to share State? and how should micro frontends share State while remaining decoupled of each other?

            "description": "<p>Micro frontends architecture is extremely powerful when it comes to splitting large frontend monoliths into smaller, individually deployable blocks, each is owned by an autonomous team and is focused on a business domain. But what about State? We are often told that micro frontends shouldn't share state, as this would make them coupled to each other. However, when it comes to complex UIs, it is not rare to encounter scenarios where state management between micro frontends is necessary. This talk is about finding the sweet spot — In which scenarios it is reasonable for micro frontends to share State? and how should micro frontends share State while remaining decoupled of each other? We discuss &#x26; compare different solutions in React. </p>\n",

You get an expanding time horizon – IF you can get it shipped.\nAn imperfect feature next week beats the perfect feature 2 months from now. Your code won’t matter if you’re dead.\nI didn’t believe this until I saw it myself. A startup on the cusp of hockeystick hired me to rewrite their jQuery app in React. Their tech proved the idea then became a burden.\nOver the next year we rewrote the whole app from scratch, grew a team of React experts, created a codebase that’s a joy to work with, and got the company to a $100,000,000 Series B. All because the early engineers knew that if the crappy version works out, there’s going to be time and resources to fix it later.\nThis talk is about what I’ve learned while rewriting an app with users banging down the door.",

                "description": "At the end of 2021, we successfully rolled out the New React Native Architecture in the Facebook app.\n\nNow, it’s time to empower every React Native developer on the globe to use the New React Native Architecture, both the new Fabric renderer and the new TurboModule system.\n\nBut migrating an entire ecosystem to a New Architecture is no easy task.\n\nTo support the whole community in this endeavor, we lined up a set of tools and materials that will help both app and library developers to join us in this journey.\n\nIn the talk, we will present how the New React Native Architecture looks in the OSS space. We will discuss the impact this will have on developing React Native projects. Lastly, we will cover what we learned from the React Native New Architecture migration at Meta, and how you can tackle your migration in your organization.",

We've done a lot of great work prioritizing accessibility and motion design for web. Our mobile experiences though, were a bit of an afterthought, but not anymore! \nIn this talk, we'll go through how we created our data viz components library;  How we encapsulated core logic, animation, types and even UI components for web and mobile; and also why keeping things separate sometimes is better - to create awesome UX.",

Yeah I too feel the same 😔\n\nLoaders are indeed a great way to provide feedbacks to users that “something is happening”. But they can be easily misused, and that day comes when we see tonnes of loaders popping in our UI, defeating its purpose. Enter Suspense and SuspenseList in React!\n\nWhat if you could think “what parts to show a loader so that I see very less loaders”? What if you could also control the order in which they should appear? Let’s dive a bit deep into this problem and think of “right loader orchestration” experience instead of “just loaders everywhere”!",
