Their tech proved the idea then became a burden.\nOver the next year we rewrote the whole app from scratch, grew a team of React experts, created a codebase that’s a joy to work with, and got the company to a $100,000,000 Series B. All because the early engineers knew that if the crappy version works out, there’s going to be time and resources to fix it later.\nThis talk is about what I’ve learned while rewriting an app with users banging down the door.",

Lastly, we will cover what we learned from the React Native New Architecture migration at Meta, and how you can tackle your migration in your organization.",

We've done a lot of great work prioritizing accessibility and motion design for web. Our mobile experiences though, were a bit of an afterthought, but not anymore! \nIn this talk, we'll go through how we created our data viz components library;  How we encapsulated core logic, animation, types and even UI components for web and mobile; and also why keeping things separate sometimes is better - to create awesome UX.",

Yeah I too feel the same 😔\n\nLoaders are indeed a great way to provide feedbacks to users that “something is happening”. But they can be easily misused, and that day comes when we see tonnes of loaders popping in our UI, defeating its purpose. Enter Suspense and SuspenseList in React!\n\nWhat if you could think “what parts to show a loader so that I see very less loaders”? What if you could also control the order in which they should appear? Let’s dive a bit deep into this problem and think of “right loader orchestration” experience instead of “just loaders everywhere”!",

                    <p>Anjana suffers from a chronic case of curiosity, which led her from philosophy to English teaching to computational linguistics to software development. As an engineer &#x26; educator, these days she mostly codes &#x26; teaches from her home base in San Francisco, when not traveling (in a mask) to events around the world to speak about the joy of programming and advocate for a more equitable &#x26; ethical tech industry. Nerd out with her about functional programming &#x26; JavaScript, ask her about the Recurse Center &#x26; Outreachy, and definitely invite her to your karaoke party!</p>

And there are secondary benefits from documentation to security to accessibility, which add up to improving long-term maintainability at scale.\n\nGet ready to be inspired by what you’ll be able to build!&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:&quot;2022-06-17T10:10:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Base Camp Track&quot;,&quot;isPrimary&quot;:true},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;design-driven-full-stack-an-end-to-end-dev-workflow-that-scales&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;david-s-price&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} })

Yeah I too feel the same 😔\n\nLoaders are indeed a great way to provide feedbacks to users that “something is happening”. But they can be easily misused, and that day comes when we see tonnes of loaders popping in our UI, defeating its purpose. Enter Suspense and SuspenseList in React!\n\nWhat if you could think “what parts to show a loader so that I see very less loaders”? What if you could also control the order in which they should appear? Let’s dive a bit deep into this problem and think of “right loader orchestration” experience instead of “just loaders everywhere”!&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Base Camp Track Remote&quot;,&quot;isPrimary&quot;:true},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;the-subtle-art-of-subtle-loading&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;nikhil-sharma&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} })

That’s when observability for teams and applications on a scale becomes even more important, in order to be able to identify potential issues in production, separate the concerns and the responsibilities among them. In this presentation we’ll learn how we can achieve this.&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Summit Track Remote&quot;,&quot;isPrimary&quot;:true},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;keeping-sane-with-react-micro-frontends-in-production-by-applying-observability&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;konstantinos-leimonis&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} })

In college, I became very interested in helping to bridge the growing digital divide and started a student organization, Tech Serv, at Drexel University. After college, I started my career as a data analyst but quickly found a career in Product Management. Here, I was able to combine my love for technology with my passion for improving the lives of others. Since that time, I&#39;ve been a product manager in a variety of industries including MarTech and HealthTech.

                    <p>As a youngster, I had an early interest in computers. I quickly learned to disassemble and reassemble my family's Tandy 1000 without much effort. This passion only grew as I got older. In college, I became very interested in helping to bridge the growing digital divide and started a student organization, Tech Serv, at Drexel University. After college, I started my career as a data analyst but quickly found a career in Product Management. Here, I was able to combine my love for technology with my passion for improving the lives of others. Since that time, I've been a product manager in a variety of industries including MarTech and HealthTech. Now at Docker, I hope to continue on my journey by improving the lives of developers and helping solve their daily challenges.</p>

You get an expanding time horizon – IF you can get it shipped.\nAn imperfect feature next week beats the perfect feature 2 months from now. Your code won’t matter if you’re dead.\nI didn’t believe this until I saw it myself. A startup on the cusp of hockeystick hired me to rewrite their jQuery app in React. Their tech proved the idea then became a burden.\nOver the next year we rewrote the whole app from scratch, grew a team of React experts, created a codebase that’s a joy to work with, and got the company to a $100,000,000 Series B. All because the early engineers knew that if the crappy version works out, there’s going to be time and resources to fix it later.\nThis talk is about what I’ve learned while rewriting an app with users banging down the door.&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:&quot;2022-06-17T15:15:00+00:00&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Summit Track Remote&quot;,&quot;isPrimary&quot;:true}}],&quot;workshops&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Senior Mindset Workshop: Think like a *True* Senior Engineer (In-Person)&quot;}],&quot;workshopsActivity&quot;:[],&quot;info&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;cl0f2t4hswne80away861229e&quot;,&quot;idAlt&quot;:&quot;cl0f2t4hswne80away861229e&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;Productivity&quot;,&quot;isNightSpeaker&quot;:null,&quot;order&quot;:null,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;cl0f2re7hwmlj0awa4vbeczp2&quot;,&quot;idMain&quot;:&quot;cl0f2re7hwmlj0awa4vbeczp2&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Swizec Teller&quot;,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;Tia&quot;,&quot;country&quot;:&quot;USA&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Swizec is a software engineer, author, educator, and conference speaker.

At work they keep giving you stupid little problems with no growth. You crave challenge and keep tweaking CSS instead. You want some responsibility, damn it! What&#39;s that coworker got that you don&#39;t? Most of all you crave autonomy. The freedom to tackle big challenges and help the company with your brilliance. They don&#39;t even see all the bad code you see! How can they live like this?? Instead of autonomy, you&#39;re getting babysat. Managers asking what you&#39;re up to, daily standups that feel like a drag, pushback and &#39;maybe someday&#39; on every idea that you give. I was like that a few years ago.

                      <p>If you don't already have a solid computer science background, most of the typical algorithms used in industry-wide job interviews can be intimidating. Moreover, even experienced engineers sometimes struggle to apply proper algorithmic thinking in their production code. This workshop starts at a basic problem/solution, and layers up to complex algorithms for a variety of challenging tasks. Whether attendees have computer science education or not, they will leave this workshop with practical algorithms knowledge, prepared to tackle problems by first thinking algorithmically and then translating that into efficient code.</p>

Many developers in the frontend space ask, “How much of this new information do I need to transition into web3?” The truth is as a React developer, the skills I know are essential in web3. Let’s add some context around how to leverage those existing skills to succeed in this new space.\n\nIn this talk, we’re going to explore how to build the correct context and the technologies to understand to help you dive into web3 as a front-end developer. We’ll go over popular packages like Ethers, which can be used in React applications to interact with wallets and existing smart contracts. We will also explore how you can leverage your Javascript skills to build full-stack dApps using managed services like Moralis and Thirdweb. \n\nLet’s demystify some of the concepts in web3 and leverage our existing skills to start building.&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:&quot;2022-06-21T16:50:00+00:00&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Summit Track Remote&quot;,&quot;isPrimary&quot;:true}}],&quot;workshops&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How to Build UI&#39;s for Smart Contracts (Remote)&quot;}],&quot;workshopsActivity&quot;:[],&quot;info&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;cl0fbayr6ysaz0cxscx70akyv&quot;,&quot;idAlt&quot;:&quot;cl0fbayr6ysaz0cxscx70akyv&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;web3&quot;,&quot;isNightSpeaker&quot;:null,&quot;order&quot;:null,&quot;speaker&quot;:{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;cl0fb5oe5yxhe0cxrw3zus7h3&quot;,&quot;idMain&quot;:&quot;cl0fb5oe5yxhe0cxrw3zus7h3&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Rahat Chowdhury&quot;,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;Polygon&quot;,&quot;country&quot;:&quot;USA&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Rahat is a hip hop artist turned web developer, indie hacker, and web3 enthusiast.

                      <p>We will go over all the blockchain/crypto basics you need to know to start building on the Hyperverse, so you do not need to have any previous knowledge about the Web3 space. You just need to have React experience. </p>

                      <p>This workshop is aimed at intermediate developers that have an existing React application, or are interested in mobile development with React. We will go over:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>What is Capacitor</li>
                        <li>How does it compare to other cross-platform solutions</li>
                        <li>Using Capacitor to build a native application using your existing web code</li>
                        <li>Tidying up our application for distribution on mobile app stores with naming conventions, icons, splashscreens and more.</li>
                      </ul>

And as we all know it can be pretty challenging. Especially when we talk about Mobile applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tests rely on many conditions and are considered to be slow and flaky. On the other hand - end-to-end tests can give the greatest confidence that your app is working. And if done right - can become an amazing tool for boosting developer velocity.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Detox is a gray-box end-to-end testing framework for mobile apps.

                    <div class="workshops-list__desc">
                      <p>Compared to unit testing, end-to-end testing aims to interact with your application just like a real user. And as we all know it can be pretty challenging. Especially when we talk about Mobile applications.</p>
                      <p>Tests rely on many conditions and are considered to be slow and flaky. On the other hand - end-to-end tests can give the greatest confidence that your app is working. And if done right - can become an amazing tool for boosting developer velocity.</p>
                      <p>Detox is a gray-box end-to-end testing framework for mobile apps. Developed by Wix to solve the problem of slowness and flakiness and <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/9a532edaaf6b80b10ce73eb8815e7f75a8c94bec/package.json#L155">used by React Native itself</a> as its E2E testing tool.</p>

                    <p>Github stars are not our criteria, and we’re looking for hidden gems (non yet maintstream), that may not have enough marketing power or huge companies behind them. The main goal of the project is to shed some light on great projects, that weren’t enough noticed in a competitive environment and hype. </p>
