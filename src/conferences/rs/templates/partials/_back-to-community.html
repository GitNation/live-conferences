				When we launched our first event five years ago, we never imagined we would welcome up to 1500 attendees at our events and organize four meetup groups and multiple spin-offs in Europe. Our secret? We welcome people from all walks of life in our community.<br / ><br />

We know that supporting diversity inside and outside of IT takes more than mere statements, which is why our diversity scholarship programs are a key part of every conference we organize.
