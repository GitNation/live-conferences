This talk delves into the concepts of mutability and observability in React and compares them to frameworks like Solid.js and Svelte. We will also discuss the debate on granular updates versus Reconciler and the potential of a plugin system to extend React applications, and the impact it could have on the React community. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of React's challenges and controversies compared to other frameworks and how the community is addressing them.</p>\n",

I have worked for about 6 years on different projects and I have faced different challenges using many programming languages such as: Haskell, Python, TypeScript, R, Elm, PowerQuery, etc. I love to learn new things and review the potential of programming languages. I’m very into functional programming and type-driven development. Apart from that, I like to develop other skills like drawing, playing the guitar, learning Japanese, etc.</p>\n",

In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course). He is one of the organizers of React Buenos Aires, the biggest React community in Argentina. He has been selected Prisma Ambassador, Auth0 Ambassador, and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.</p>\n",

It's great that the emergence of trends such as e2e testing has enabled us to validate the user workflow earlier. However, they do not eliminate the need to monitor this workflow against a live production system. I have seen that the segregation of development and support teams leads to both teams using different tools to build similar automation that simply targets different environments of the same software.<br />By joining forces, we can build automated scripts that can be used both for production monitoring and testing within CI. In this talk, I will discuss the causes of this cultural divide, and why this needs to change for us to shift user testing both left and right. Furthermore, I shall show how this can be achieved using Playwright and Elastic Synthetics and also chat through the challenges you may face shifting left and right.</span></p>\n",

After more than 12 years working as a developer, creating products and projects for different organizations and clients, he thought it would be great to combine those three interests in some way. In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course). He is one of the organizers of React Buenos Aires, the biggest React community in Argentina. He has been selected Prisma Ambassador, Auth0 Ambassador, and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.",

It's great that the emergence of trends such as e2e testing has enabled us to validate the user workflow earlier. However, they do not eliminate the need to monitor this workflow against a live production system. I have seen that the segregation of development and support teams leads to both teams using different tools to build similar automation that simply targets different environments of the same software.By joining forces, we can build automated scripts that can be used both for production monitoring and testing within CI.",

I have worked for about 6 years on different projects and I have faced different challenges using many programming languages such as: Haskell, Python, TypeScript, R, Elm, PowerQuery, etc. I love to learn new things and review the potential of programming languages. I’m very into functional programming and type-driven development. Apart from that, I like to develop other skills like drawing, playing the guitar, learning Japanese, etc.",

Also, while data-fetching libraries have made it a lot easier to work with REST nowadays, GraphQL still has properties that are just not present in traditional REST APIs, and on top of that GraphQL has kept evolving.

                  <p>I found my love for computers at the age of 8 and haven’t looked back ever since. I built a bunch of products (builderX) and OSS (NativeBase) and lead a consulting company of 500+ folks. I am very fortunate to combine my two passions, design and code, into what I do for a living. I am Sanket, founder at GeekyAnts and still a developer at heart. Currently, I spend my days in my self designed caravan, learning what it’s like to live as a digital nomad and I can’t wait to share my stories with you!</p>

The presentation will dive into the history and evolution of platform shifts, and focus on the most exciting transactional problems presented in the modern monoliths world that&#39;s edge-native, 100% Javascript -- and argue why the word \&quot;serverless\&quot; is out of date :)&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;architecture&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;the-rise-of-modern-transactional-stack&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;yoko-li&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} })

Hit Reset with a Sabbatical or LOA&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Tech is tiring. Whether you’re trying to stay upskilled on the latest JavaScript framework or wading through toxic work swamps, it feels like burnout is constantly looming on the horizon. Sabbaticals and leaves of absence (LOAs) are two benefits you could take advantage of to catch a much-needed (and overdue) extended break. I’ve taken both, one time to live abroad in France for 6 months and the other time to take the summer off for 10 weeks, both at different Fortune 500 companies and each time they moved my career forward, not backward. I’ll walk through step-by-step how to figure out if you’re eligible for these benefits, break down the implications to insurance and job security in plain language, and illustrate some strategies on bridging the income gap so you can sleep at night. By the end you’ll walk away with the confidence to finally give yourself permission to reset and get excited about tech again.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;career&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;tired-of-tech-hit-reset-with-a-sabbatical-or-loa&quot;}],&quot;offlineTalks&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1295,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Tired of Tech?

And thus helps us find new approaches to solving real-world problems. Phew...

It&#39;s great that the emergence of trends such as e2e testing has enabled us to validate the user workflow earlier. However, they do not eliminate the need to monitor this workflow against a live production system. I have seen that the segregation of development and support teams leads to both teams using different tools to build similar automation that simply targets different environments of the same software.&lt;br /&gt;By joining forces, we can build automated scripts that can be used both for production monitoring and testing within CI. In this talk, I will discuss the causes of this cultural divide, and why this needs to change for us to shift user testing both left and right. Furthermore, I shall show how this can be achieved using Playwright and Elastic Synthetics and also chat through the challenges you may face shifting left and right.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;e2e testing&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;synthetic-monitoring-and-e2e-testing-2-sides-of-the-same-coin&quot;}],&quot;offlineTalks&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1296,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Synthetic Monitoring and E2E Testing - 2 Sides of the Same Coin&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the last few years, there has been a great focus on shifting tests left to earlier in the software development cycle.

This workshop will provide a deep dive into the language, and basic TypeScript knowledge is assumed. We will briefly discuss the design philosophy of TypeScript, and then cover all the lesser-known or harder features. That is: do all the cool and weird meta programming stuff (TS is turing complete!) and learn the tricks you won&#39;t find in the handbook.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So join if you feel like you&#39;re writing too much type annotations to make TypeScript happy! We&#39;ll dive deep into how type inference and control flows works, and how you can make the compiler work for you. We&#39;ll discuss all the fancier language constructs like:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ReturnType&amp;#x3C;&gt;, Parameters&amp;#x3C;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;typeof, keyof&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mapped types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ConditionalTypes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Function overloading&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Discrimination unions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Type guards and type assertions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;String template types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(Variadic) tuple types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: May 30 (Group 1) &amp;#x26; May 31 (Group 2), 9:00-18:00 CEST.

New APIs were introduced and certain behaviour changed. Some of these changes have quite an impact on your daily development, while others rarely affect you. Nevertheless, only by knowing your tools can you best decide when to use which of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In order to get a deep understanding of these new APIs and behaviour changes we will explore the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;new concurrent rendering APIs: useTransition, startTransition, useDeferredValue&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;new Hooks: useId, useSyncExternalStore, useInsertionEffect&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;strict effects in the new Strict Mode and revisiting useEffect&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;automatic batching and flushSync&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;sneak peek into what&#39;s coming after React 18 including a brief introduction into &lt;Suspense&gt; and &lt;SuspenseList&gt; for data fetching&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The workshop is split into several modules. Each of them starts with a 20 min presentation, 30-50 min coding session and is followed by a 10 min retrospective. The final topic about what&#39;s coming after React 18 is only covered as a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By the end of the workshop you will be able to leverage the new features of React 18 and be able to use them in production ready applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;level&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: May 31, 9:00-18:00 CEST.

But that doesn’t mean testing is easy. There are still a lot of questions you have to figure out for yourself: How many component tests should you write vs end-to-end tests or lower-level unit tests? How can you test a certain line of code that is tricky to test? And what in the world are you supposed to do about that persistent &lt;code&gt;act()&lt;/code&gt; warning?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this three-hour workshop we’ll introduce React Testing Library along with a mental model for how to think about designing your component tests. This mental model will help you see how to test each bit of logic, whether or not to mock dependencies, and will help improve the design of your components. You’ll walk away with the tools, techniques, and principles you need to implement low-cost, high-value component tests.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:&quot;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with building applications with React&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Basic experience writing automated tests with Jest or another unit testing framework&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You do not need any experience with React Testing Library&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Machine setup: Node LTS, Yarn&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;The different kinds of React application tests, and where component tests fit in&quot;,&quot;A mental model for thinking about the inputs and outputs of the components you test&quot;,&quot;Options for selecting DOM elements to verify and interact with them&quot;,&quot;The value of mocks and why they shouldn’t be avoided&quot;,&quot;The challenges with asynchrony in RTL tests and how to handle them&quot;],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: June 14, 16:00-19:00 CEST.

He would see a slow interaction, try a random optimization, see that it didn&#39;t help, and keep trying other optimizations until he found the right one (or gave up).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Back then, Ivan didn’t know how to use performance devtools well. He would do a recording in Chrome DevTools or React Profiler, poke around it, try clicking random things, and then close it in frustration a few minutes later. Now, Ivan knows exactly where and what to look for. And in this workshop, Ivan will teach you that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s how this is going to work. We’ll take a slow app → debug it (using tools like Chrome DevTools, React Profiler, and &lt;code&gt;why-did-you-render&lt;/code&gt;) → pinpoint the bottleneck → and then repeat, several times more. We won’t talk about the solutions (in 90% of the cases, it’s just the ol’ regular &lt;code&gt;useMemo()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;memo()&lt;/code&gt;). But we’ll talk about everything that comes before – and learn how to analyze any React performance problem, step by step.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(Note: This workshop is best suited for engineers who are already familiar with how &lt;code&gt;useMemo()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;memo()&lt;/code&gt; work – but want to get better at using the performance tools around React. Also, we’ll be covering interaction performance, not load speed, so you won’t hear a word about Lighthouse 🤐)&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: June 19, 16:00-19:30 CEST.

The differences between Android and iOS require developers to use specific tools and processes for each platform, including hardware requirements for iOS. Manual deployments also make it difficult to manage signing credentials, environment configurations, track releases, and to collaborate as a team. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Appflow is the cloud mobile DevOps platform built by Ionic. Using a service like Appflow to build React Native apps not only provides access to powerful computing resources, it can simplify the deployment process by providing a centralized environment for managing and distributing your app to multiple platforms. This can save time and resources, enable collaboration, as well as improve the overall reliability and scalability of an app.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, you’ll deploy a React Native application for delivery to Android and iOS test devices using Appflow. You’ll also learn the steps for publishing to Google Play and Apple App Stores. No previous experience with deploying native applications is required, and you’ll come away with a deeper understanding of the mobile deployment process and best practices for how to use a cloud mobile DevOps platform to ship quickly at scale.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:&quot;&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A React Native application hosted on a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.

Working in direct contact with many customers, he obtained many other skills related to product management, design, and marketing. \n\nWhen he&#39;s not speaking to customers or coding through sprints, you&#39;ll find Kevin either on the road driving fast up a twisty mountain road, reading historical fiction books, or looking for a new place in the world to travel to and explore.&quot;,&quot;githubUrl&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/gaokevin1&quot;,&quot;portalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/kevin_gao&quot;,&quot;twitterUrl&quot;:null,&quot;mediumUrl&quot;:null,&quot;ownSite&quot;:null,&quot;avatar&quot;:{&quot;handle&quot;:&quot;IzHP8R1bTleSG1DnnttS&quot;,&quot;mimeType&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://media.graphassets.com/resize=fit:crop,height:500,width:500/output=format:jpg/IzHP8R1bTleSG1DnnttS&quot;},&quot;lightningTalks&quot;:[],&quot;talks&quot;:[],&quot;workshops&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;0 to Auth in an hour with ReactJS&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;0-to-auth-in-an-hour-with-react-js&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:null}],&quot;workshopsActivity&quot;:[],&quot;info&quot;:[]},&quot;trainers&quot;:[],&quot;id&quot;:&quot;clglx753206qe0bukmbzvu7zi&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;0 to Auth in an hour with ReactJS&quot;,&quot;toc&quot;:[&quot;A quick intro to core authentication concepts&quot;,&quot;Coding&quot;,&quot;Why passwordless matters&quot;],&quot;duration&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Passwordless authentication may seem complex, but it is simple to add it to any app using the right tool. There are multiple alternatives that are much better than passwords to identify and authenticate your users - including SSO, SAML, OAuth, Magic Links, One-Time Passwords, and Authenticator Apps.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While addressing security aspects and avoiding common pitfalls, we will enhance a full-stack JS application (Node.js backend + React frontend) to authenticate users with OAuth (social login) and One Time Passwords (email), including:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;User authentication - Managing user interactions, returning session / refresh JWTs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Session management and validation - Storing the session securely for subsequent client requests, validating / refreshing sessions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Basic Authorization - extracting and validating claims from the session token JWT and handling authorization in backend flows&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At the end of the workshop, we will also touch other approaches of authentication implementation with Descope - using frontend or backend SDKs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;(If you want to code together during the session as well)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;IDE for your choice (we will be using VS Code)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Node 16 or higher&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ChatGPT (JK 🙂)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;A quick intro to core authentication concepts&quot;,&quot;Coding&quot;,&quot;Why passwordless matters&quot;],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;Beginners.&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: May 15, 17:00-18:00 CEST.

                  <p>We’re looking specifically at open source projects or initiatives, with or without a code, but following an open and transparent culture, open for collaboration and contributions from any person interested. </p>
                  <p>Github stars are not our criteria, and we’re looking for hidden gems (non yet maintstream), that may not have enough marketing power or huge companies behind them. The main goal of the project is to shed some light on great projects, that weren’t enough noticed in a competitive environment and hype. </p>
