React is often a go-to choice for such sites to bring interactivity, but eager hydration often negatively affects startup performance. New frameworks such as Qwik focus on startup performance but would require a full rewrite. Qwik-React is a bridging technology that allows React components to be executed inside Qwik. The advantage is that each React component can become its own islands which can be lazily hydrated on click, mouseover or visibility. This approach allows you to improve your site performance without a costly rewrite.</p>\n",
                "description": "<p>Application startup performance impacts a business's bottom line, especially in sites that focus on conversion. React is often a go-to choice for such sites to bring interactivity, but eager hydration often negatively affects startup performance. New frameworks such as Qwik focus on startup performance but would require a full rewrite. Qwik-React is a bridging technology that allows React components to be executed inside Qwik. The advantage is that each React component can become its own islands which can be lazily hydrated on click, mouseover or visibility. This approach allows you to improve your site performance without a costly rewrite.</p>\n",

I have worked for about 6 years on different projects and I have faced different challenges using many programming languages such as: Haskell, Python, TypeScript, R, Elm, PowerQuery, etc. I love to learn new things and review the potential of programming languages. I’m very into functional programming and type-driven development. Apart from that, I like to develop other skills like drawing, playing the guitar, learning Japanese, etc.</p>\n",

In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course).

I have seen that the segregation of development and support teams leads to both teams using different tools to build similar automation that simply targets different environments of the same software.<br />By joining forces, we can build automated scripts that can be used both for production monitoring and testing within CI. In this talk, I will discuss the causes of this cultural divide, and why this needs to change for us to shift user testing both left and right.

After more than 12 years working as a developer, creating products and projects for different organizations and clients, he thought it would be great to combine those three interests in some way. In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course). He is one of the organizers of React Buenos Aires, the biggest React community in Argentina. He has been selected Prisma Ambassador, Auth0 Ambassador, and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.",

Environment variables, HTTP requests, forms and so on could create troubles in our applications, mainly if they contain unexpected types. Using Zod, we can create schemas to guarantee the types expected in our editor at runtime. In this way, we can react quickly when an environment variable misses or when someone changes the API contract without informing us.A small validation layer in our applications can prevent a bad user experience and notify us immediately, so we can fix the problem as soon as possible and mitigate the visualization of wrong data.",

It's great that the emergence of trends such as e2e testing has enabled us to validate the user workflow earlier. However, they do not eliminate the need to monitor this workflow against a live production system. I have seen that the segregation of development and support teams leads to both teams using different tools to build similar automation that simply targets different environments of the same software.<br />By joining forces, we can build automated scripts that can be used both for production monitoring and testing within CI. In this talk, I will discuss the causes of this cultural divide, and why this needs to change for us to shift user testing both left and right. Furthermore, I shall show how this can be achieved using Playwright and Elastic Synthetics and also chat through the challenges you may face shifting left and right.</span></p>\n",

And thus helps us find new approaches to solving real-world problems. Phew... That sounds complex… And how is that supposed to be fun?\nWell, in addition to the big issues of our time, it is ultimately just another tool that we can play with. While it is important to first understand the core concepts of machine learning, we can quickly go way beyond that. Get ready for some unexpected examples of how to get started with machine learning in your React application!</p>\n",

I have worked for about 6 years on different projects and I have faced different challenges using many programming languages such as: Haskell, Python, TypeScript, R, Elm, PowerQuery, etc. I love to learn new things and review the potential of programming languages. I’m very into functional programming and type-driven development. Apart from that, I like to develop other skills like drawing, playing the guitar, learning Japanese, etc.",
