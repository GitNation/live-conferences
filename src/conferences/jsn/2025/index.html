										"description": "<p>Ever used an app that crashed and thought, \"Why can’t this just work?\" For users, it’s frustrating. For businesses, it’s expensive. As JavaScript developers, we’re stuck in the middle - juggling frontend tweaks, backend performance, and monitoring tools to figure out what went wrong. That’s where observability comes in because understanding your code is like going to the gym. No shortcuts, no pills. You gotta put in the work to put on the muscle.  It’s not just some SRE buzzword anymore but a must-have for developers. Observability helps you spot issues, understand system behavior, and fix problems faster. And with OpenTelemetry, you get an open-source framework to manage logs, traces, and metrics without vendor lock-in. </p><p>In this session, you’ll learn, all things observability, optimize both frontend and backend, and integrate OpenTelemetry to gain insights into your system. Moreover, you'll also learn how to practically integrate OpenTelemetry into your JavaScript apps, to create spans, track activities, name them effectively. The result? Fewer headaches, better performance, and apps that not just works but you completely understands.<span></span><br /></p>\n",

My focus: transforming how we build intelligence, not just software. From architecting AI agents that power Tableau’s next-gen analytics, to driving cross-functional collaboration across global teams, I thrive at the intersection of vision, velocity, and impact.\n\nBut my mission goes beyond what happens inside one company.\n\nThrough Peak Potential, the career accelerator I founded, I’ve helped hundreds of senior engineers and leaders grow into staff-level and leadership roles. I’ve seen firsthand how the right mix of mindset, mentorship, and strategy can unlock careers – and change lives.\n\nWhether I’m coaching engineers to find their voice, scaling systems for millions, or running and scaling a business (yes, I believe in bringing heart to everything I do), I lead with purpose and a deep belief in the potential of people.\n\nIf you're building the future of tech, growing into your next big role, or reimagining what's possible – let’s connect.",

For businesses, it’s expensive. As JavaScript developers, we’re stuck in the middle - juggling frontend tweaks, backend performance, and monitoring tools to figure out what went wrong. That’s where observability comes in because understanding your code is like going to the gym. No shortcuts, no pills. You gotta put in the work to put on the muscle.  It’s not just some SRE buzzword anymore but a must-have for developers.

Moreover, you&#39;ll also learn how to practically integrate OpenTelemetry into your JavaScript apps, to create spans, track activities, name them effectively. The result?

Plus, who doesn&#39;t like a bit of live coding? ✨&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;case study&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:0,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;build-your-own-reactivity-a-deep-dive-into-signals&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;build-your-own-reactivity-a-deep-dive-into-signals&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;carl-vuorinen&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} });

This talk explores combining AI techniques like RAG and function calling with advanced browser APIs (e.g., WebBluetooth) to create a browser-based AI agent with personality, memory, and autonomy, powered by WebAssembly and WebGPU - fully offline and privacy-preserving!&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;browser api&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:0,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;lets-build-kitt-with-javascript&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;let-s-build-k-i-t-t-with-java-script&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;nico-martin&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} });

This shift can be disorienting because being a tech lead isn’t just about technology, it’s about people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing from my experience as a tech lead at ThoughtWorks and coaching over 300 tech leads, I’ll explore why this role is uniquely complex. Positioned at the intersection of people, technology, and business, tech leads must develop critical soft skills like delegation, conflict resolution, and team alignment, yet most are thrown into the role without support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this session, we’ll uncover why most tech problems are actually people problems and how to address them.

A large number of web and JS applications now leverage large language models (LLMs), vector search / RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for building better user experiences. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now the tide is shifting, and we have entered the era of AI agents. This is a promising field which combines the different generative AI usecases and helps to simplify the process of interacting with Gen AI by essentially making agents act like humans and makes interactions feel more human like to solve problems in an automated fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, while we give a quick over view of LLMs, RAG, we will dive deeper into concepts of AI Agents such has how one can leverage LLMs for specific tasks. How can we include tool calling / function calling in AI Agents. Thus showing how an AI Agent is a system that is capable of independently deciding which functions or data sources to used to efficiently execute users&#39; orders.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We will show how to develop an AI agent that runs purely on the browser vs running them using cloud.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This workshop is for javaScript developers, AI enthusiasts, and tech innovators who want to integrate the use of AI within web applications to create intelligent and interactive app experiences.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Table of contents:&lt;br&gt;\n1.

In this hands-on workshop, I&#39;ll show you how to leverage Cline (an autonomous coding agent that recently hit 1M VS Code downloads) to dramatically accelerate your development workflow through a practice we call \&quot;vibe coding\&quot; - where humans focus on high-level thinking and AI handles the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll discover:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The fundamental principles of \&quot;vibe coding\&quot; and how it differs from traditional development&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to architect solutions at a high level and have AI implement them accurately&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Live demo: Building a production-grade caching system in Go that saved us $500/week&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Techniques for using AI to understand complex codebases in minutes instead of hours&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best practices for prompting AI agents to get exactly the code you want&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Common pitfalls to avoid when working with AI coding assistants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strategies for using AI to accelerate learning and reduce dependency on senior engineers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to effectively combine human creativity with AI implementation capabilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re a junior developer looking to accelerate your learning or a senior engineer wanting to optimize your workflow, you&#39;ll leave this workshop with practical experience in AI-assisted development that you can immediately apply to your projects. Through live coding demos and hands-on exercises, you&#39;ll learn how to leverage Cline to write better code faster while focusing on what matters - solving real problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;startDate&quot;:&quot;2025-06-18T16:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;endDate&quot;:&quot;2025-06-18T17:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;workshopExtensions&quot;:[{&quot;includedToPackage&quot;:true,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;June 18, 18:00-19:00 CET.
