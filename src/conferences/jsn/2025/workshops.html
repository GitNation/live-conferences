As JavaScript developers, we’re stuck in the middle - juggling frontend tweaks, backend performance, and monitoring tools to figure out what went wrong. That’s where observability comes in because understanding your code is like going to the gym. No shortcuts, no pills. You gotta put in the work to put on the muscle.  It’s not just some SRE buzzword anymore but a must-have for developers. Observability helps you spot issues, understand system behavior, and fix problems faster. And with OpenTelemetry, you get an open-source framework to manage logs, traces, and metrics without vendor lock-in. </p><p>In this session, you’ll learn, all things observability, optimize both frontend and backend, and integrate OpenTelemetry to gain insights into your system. Moreover, you'll also learn how to practically integrate OpenTelemetry into your JavaScript apps, to create spans, track activities, name them effectively. The result? Fewer headaches, better performance, and apps that not just works but you completely understands.<span></span><br /></p>\n",

										"description": "<p>Ever used an app that crashed and thought, \"Why can’t this just work?\" For users, it’s frustrating. For businesses, it’s expensive. As JavaScript developers, we’re stuck in the middle - juggling frontend tweaks, backend performance, and monitoring tools to figure out what went wrong. That’s where observability comes in because understanding your code is like going to the gym. No shortcuts, no pills. You gotta put in the work to put on the muscle.  It’s not just some SRE buzzword anymore but a must-have for developers. Observability helps you spot issues, understand system behavior, and fix problems faster. And with OpenTelemetry, you get an open-source framework to manage logs, traces, and metrics without vendor lock-in. </p><p>In this session, you’ll learn, all things observability, optimize both frontend and backend, and integrate OpenTelemetry to gain insights into your system. Moreover, you'll also learn how to practically integrate OpenTelemetry into your JavaScript apps, to create spans, track activities, name them effectively. The result? Fewer headaches, better performance, and apps that not just works but you completely understands.<span></span><br /></p>\n",

My focus: transforming how we build intelligence, not just software. From architecting AI agents that power Tableau’s next-gen analytics, to driving cross-functional collaboration across global teams, I thrive at the intersection of vision, velocity, and impact.\n\nBut my mission goes beyond what happens inside one company.\n\nThrough Peak Potential, the career accelerator I founded, I’ve helped hundreds of senior engineers and leaders grow into staff-level and leadership roles. I’ve seen firsthand how the right mix of mindset, mentorship, and strategy can unlock careers – and change lives.\n\nWhether I’m coaching engineers to find their voice, scaling systems for millions, or running and scaling a business (yes, I believe in bringing heart to everything I do), I lead with purpose and a deep belief in the potential of people.\n\nIf you're building the future of tech, growing into your next big role, or reimagining what's possible – let’s connect.",

From architecting AI agents that power Tableau’s next-gen analytics, to driving cross-functional collaboration across global teams, I thrive at the intersection of vision, velocity, and impact.\n\nBut my mission goes beyond what happens inside one company.\n\nThrough Peak Potential, the career accelerator I founded, I’ve helped hundreds of senior engineers and leaders grow into staff-level and leadership roles. I’ve seen firsthand how the right mix of mindset, mentorship, and strategy can unlock careers – and change lives.\n\nWhether I’m coaching engineers to find their voice, scaling systems for millions, or running and scaling a business (yes, I believe in bringing heart to everything I do), I lead with purpose and a deep belief in the potential of people.\n\nIf you're building the future of tech, growing into your next big role, or reimagining what's possible – let’s connect.",

									<h3>React Query - Beyond the Basics (in-person workshop pass)</h3>
									<p>In this workshop, we'll go beyond the fundamentals and explore some of the more powerful features React Query has to offer. You'll gain a deeper understanding of how it works under the hood and learn how to write scalable, maintainable React Query code.</p>
									<p>Together, we'll build a simple example app and incrementally enhance it with one core objective in mind: delivering the best possible user experience. That means snappy interactions, minimal layout shifts, and avoiding unnecessary loading spinners wherever we can.</p>
									<p>To achieve this, we'll dive into advanced techniques like various forms of prefetching (including integration with route loaders), seeding the query cache, crafting smooth paginated experiences, and even persisting query state through full page reloads using persistence plugins.</p>
									<p>Note: You should have prior knowledge about React Query if you attend this workshop.</p>

									<h3>Bringing and Running AI Agents in the Browser (in-person workshop pass)</h3>
									<p>In the past few years, there have been a large number of generative AI use cases and adoption has grown increasingly. A large number of web and JS applications now leverage large language models (LLMs), vector search / RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for building better user experiences. </p>
									<p>Now the tide is shifting, and we have entered the era of AI agents. This is a promising field which combines the different generative AI usecases and helps to simplify the process of interacting with Gen AI by essentially making agents act like humans and makes interactions feel more human like to solve problems in an automated fashion.</p>
									<p>In this workshop, while we give a quick over view of LLMs, RAG, we will dive deeper into concepts of AI Agents such has how one can leverage LLMs for specific tasks. How can we include tool calling / function calling in AI Agents. Thus showing how an AI Agent is a system that is capable of independently deciding which functions or data sources to used to efficiently execute users' orders.</p>
									<p>We will show how to develop an AI agent that runs purely on the browser vs running them using cloud. </p>
									<p>This workshop is for javaScript developers, AI enthusiasts, and tech innovators who want to integrate the use of AI within web applications to create intelligent and interactive app experiences.</p>
									<p>Table of contents:<br> 1. Intro to the general landscape of LLMs, RAG 2. What are AI Agents 3. Core components of AI Agents 4. How to build your first AI Agent with JavaScript 5. Stack to build AI Agents in the browser with open source models</p>

									<h3>Defensive Coding (in-person workshop pass)</h3>
									<p>Malicious code is out to get you. Can you keep your app working as expected and hold on to your secrets? Come to this workshop and try!</p>
									<p>The entire workshop will be delivered as bite-sized hands-on exercises where increasingly advanced threats are presented and you get to defend. </p>
									<p>No matter if you're concerned with malicious npm packages or building software to run other people's code, techniques presented in this workshop can be used to isolate JavaScript at runtime and protect against prototype poisoning.</p>
									<p>We'll explore techniques allowing cooperation with packages that intend to steal your secrets and mess with built-in functionality of JavaScript via prototype-poisoning. Another part of the workshop will focus on using tools to isolate code and scale the defensive coding practice up for larger codebases.</p>
									<p>If you're not dealing with security-critical code, it's a great opportunity to expand your awareness of rarely explored areas of JavaScript knowledge.</p>
