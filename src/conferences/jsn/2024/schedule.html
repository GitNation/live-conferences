                            <div class="sv-item__text">The introduction of ChatGPT, Whisper API, and its orchestration tool such as Langchain, Semantic Kernel brings in a lot of hype over AI and what we can build with AI, such as a document assistant. But are we ready to scale our AI project to meet further requirements and broader scenarios, such as handing multiple processes within a document question and answer flow, or offering industry-specific answers with the existing codebase? How can we, as developers, leverage these tools to offer a better experience in documentation for developers as our users? Join my talk and let's find out.</div>

                            <div class="sv-item__text">One of the most common issues in JavaScript code bases is that our code is too complex. As projects and their requirements evolve, complexity creeps in. Excess complexity slows progress, frustrating us as we try to keep large chunks of a program in our heads just to understand what is happening.To conquer complexity, we must refactor! In this talk, we'll investigate how to identify unnecessary complexity in our code base using cognitive complexity as a measure, how to approach refactoring complex code, and what tools are available to help us refactor.</div>

We will begin with an overview of Cloudflare Workers and how they enable running JavaScript at the edge. Then, we will discuss browser automation in detail, covering how to interact with the DOM, fill out forms, and scrape data from web pages. We will showcase real-world examples of how browser automation with Cloudflare Workers can improve the user experience of web applications, increase productivity, and automate tasks, such as generating screenshots and PDFs of web pages, testing web applications, and running performance audits.
