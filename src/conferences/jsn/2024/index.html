Are you aware that in June 2025, you are probably, by law, obligated to deliver accessible features?</p><p><br /></p><p>Developing inclusive user experiences is a challenge when accessibility doesn't have the right priority. It isn't just about inclusiveness – it's about potential Return on Investment (ROI) that is too significant to ignore.</p><p><br /></p><p>Statistics show that 1 out of 4 European adults has some form of disability. Imagine being able to tap into a roughly 25% bigger market reach. Accessible web services perform better in search engine results because web semantics are key. They enable users to accomplish their goals more efficiently, as the focus is on inclusive user experience.</p><p><br /></p><p>With the European Accessibility Act coming into effect, the awareness around digital accessibility will shift. I predict digital accessibility will land on the company's radar from 2024 onward.</p><p><br /></p><p>At the end of this session, you will have the fundaments to pitch digital accessibility to your stakeholders.</p><p><br /></p><p>We'll cover what digital accessibility is, how a company will reap the benefits of investing in it and what a mature accessibility program could look like, so with it, you can kick-start your company's accessibility program.</p>\n",

Picture this: AI handles the boring parts, letting you unleash your creativity on the stuff that really matters. But let’s hit the brakes for a second—could this wizardry actually boot us out of our own jobs? In this eye-opening talk, we’ll dive deep into AI tools that can level up your coding and design skills. We’ll also tackle the burning question everyone’s thinking but not asking: Is AI your future sidekick or the one that’ll swipe your job?

Join Jason Mayes, Web AI Lead at Google, who will get you on track by demystifying common terminology ensuring no one is left behind, and then take you through some of the latest machine learning models, tools, and frameworks you can use right in the browser via JavaScript to help you bring your creative web app ideas to life for almost any industry you may be working in. By moving AI to the client side, there is no reliance on the server after the page load, bringing you benefits such as privacy, low latency, offline solutions, and lower costs which will be of growing importance as the field develops. This talk is suitable for everyone with a curiosity for web and machine learning, so come along and learn something new to put in your web engineering toolkit for 2024.</p>\n",

You may have heard terms like \"accessibility APIs\", “accessibility tree” or \"accessible name computation\". But what do they refer to, really? </p><p>In this talk, we will demystify the process in which browsers generate and update the accessibility tree. We will look into its key elements, and how HTML elements and ARIA attributes map into it. Lastly, we will explore how web developers can leverage it for effective debugging. Let's dive into the inner workings of screen readers-browsers interactions!</p>\n",

They offer a unified development experience while still enabling the distribution of more fine-grained packages for easy consumption. In fact, many popular OSS libraries follow such an approach such as Vue, Angular, React, Vite, Tanstack and RxJS (just to name a few). However, the publishing process within monorepos introduces unique challenges, particularly when dealing with multiple interdependent packages. And yes, there are solutions out there for versioning and releasing packages, but they often fall short when it comes to monorepos. Nx recently introduced a \&quot;release\&quot; command tailored for these scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my talk, I&#39;ll explore how we can setup a publishing process, covering versioning, changelog generation, and releasing to platforms like NPM and GitHub (including provenance support).

Tired of repetitive tasks and boilerplate code? Picture this: AI handles the boring parts, letting you unleash your creativity on the stuff that really matters. But let’s hit the brakes for a second—could this wizardry actually boot us out of our own jobs?

But do you really know TypeScript? Join Josh Goldberg, author of Learning TypeScript (O’Reilly) in a deep dive into your favorite strongly typed flavor of JavaScript. We’ll learn how to really use the type system to your advantage to help write readable, type-safe, TypeScript code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This interactive workshop will build up your TypeScript mastery through the following sections:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Structural typing: Recapping how the type system fundamentally works with inferred vs. explicit object types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Using IDE features: Code navigation, name completions, and error debugging that level up any JavaScript and/or TypeScript developer.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shape satisfaction: Showing different ways to create objects that partially or completely adhere to shapes, including with the new &lt;code&gt;satisfies&lt;/code&gt; keyword&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Type modifiers: Using the &lt;code&gt;keyof&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt; type-system-only keywords to infer types from values or other types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Generics: Using type parameters, especially in conjunction with &lt;code&gt;keyof&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;typeof&lt;/code&gt;, to introduce reusability into the type system&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mapped types: Transforming existing types into new ones for flexibility and reusability&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Conditional types: Introducing logic into the type system for some truly dynamic types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Miscellaneous: You tell me! We’ll spend the rest of the day covering any questions you have.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Throughout the workshop, we’ll be building up a small version of the popular “Zod” library that can define and validate schemas along with their types. You’ll emerge with a working mini-Zod and a renewed appreciation for the inference libraries like it provide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Each session consists of a ~30-45 minute interactive lecture+workshop, with 15 minutes in-between for bio breaks and miscellaneous questions, and a lunch break in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;Intermediate/advanced.&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: June 12, 9:00-18:00 CEST.

Everyone is. While React has not yet officially released server components and actions as features in a stable version of React, you want to understand how these features work because you’d like to use them within one of the frameworks built on top of React which has support for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this workshop we won’t be using any frameworks. In fact you might say we’ll be building our own framework. It’s important for you to understand at least one or two layers below where you typically operate to be able to use your abstractions effectively. So we’ll be working with the raw/unreleased/experimental/futuristic APIs for React Server Components and React Server Actions.\nOnce you finish this workshop, you’ll finally have the proper mental model for what server components and actions will do for you as an every day React app developer. Whatever kind of React app you’re building (and whatever architecture you have), you’ll find ways to apply these future features to your application eventually and after this workshop you’ll be eager to do so for the DX and UX improvements they provide.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[&quot;The relationship between client and server components and their respective module graphs&quot;,&quot;Streaming serialized React elements&quot;,&quot;Submitting forms to server actions&quot;,&quot;Managing pending state for server actions&quot;,&quot;Providing great loading UX with optimistic UI&quot;],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: June 19-20, 16:00-20:00 CEST.

                <p>Amsterdam is known for its nightlife and all our attendees get an invitation to join in. If you get full access, you'll get to see various kinds of performances made with JS at the biggest JS party worldwide on June 14. </p>
                <p>Aside from that, the extended program for in-person attendees will also offer a karaoke party and silent disco with music for everyone playing on 3 channels. Afterwards, on June 15, we'll explore the capital of the Netherlands together at walking tours and boat tours. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>So come hang out with your fellow devs in Amsterdam! June 14 – afterparty at the same venue; June 15 – walking tours and boat tours.</li>
