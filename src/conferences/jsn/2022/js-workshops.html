                                <p>If you don't already have a solid computer science background, most of the typical algorithms used in industry-wide job interviews can be intimidating. Moreover, even experienced engineers sometimes struggle to apply proper algorithmic thinking in their production code. This workshop starts at a basic problem/solution, and layers up to complex algorithms for a variety of challenging tasks. Whether attendees have computer science education or not, they will leave this workshop with practical algorithms knowledge, prepared to tackle problems by first thinking algorithmically and then translating that into efficient code.</p>

                                <p>React 18 was a long-awaited release. New APIs were introduced and certain behaviour changed. Some of these changes have quite an impact on your daily development, while others rarely affect you. Nevertheless, only by knowing your tools can you best decide when to use which of them.</p>
                                <p>In order to get a deep understanding of these new APIs and behaviour changes we will explore the following topics (see table of content).</p>
                                <p>The workshop is split into several modules. Each of them starts with a 20 min presentation, 30-50 min coding session and is followed by a 10 min retrospective. The final topic about what's coming after React 18 is only covered as a presentation.</p>
                                <p>By the end of the workshop you will be able to leverage the new features of React 18 and be able to use them in production ready applications.</p>

                                <p>Getting that senior title is easy. Just stick around. Being a true senior takes a new way of thinking.</p>
                                <p>You're a great engineer. You can code anything you need, solve every problem, google any solution. Your code is flying.</p>
                                <p>But somehow you're ... stuck. Interviewing feels rough, you pass the coding and fail the real stuff. Culture and system. At work they keep giving you stupid little problems with no growth. You crave challenge and keep tweaking CSS instead. You want some responsibility, damn it! What's that coworker got that you don't? Most of all you crave autonomy. The freedom to tackle big challenges and help the company with your brilliance. They don't even see all the bad code you see! How can they live like this?? Instead of autonomy, you're getting babysat. Managers asking what you're up to, daily standups that feel like a drag, pushback and 'maybe someday' on every idea that you give. I was like that a few years ago. A totally senior engineer who keeps running into walls and getting stuck. Now even bigger companies trust me with designing systems and leading teams on projects that could make or break the company. In this workshop you'll learn what changed and how to apply the Senior Mindset to your work and career:</p>
                                <ul>
                                  <li>How to gain autonomy</li>
                                  <li>Inspire trust</li>
                                  <li>Own large projects</li>
                                  <li>Get freedom to experiment</li>
                                  <li>Have your ideas heard</li>
                                  <li>Think like an expert</li>
                                  <li>Become a decision-making peer, not a pair of hands</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>You'll work on case studies, analyze anecdotes, discuss insightful books, and look at your work and career in a new light.</p>

                                <p>Now that you're on your feet with the basics of Remix, we can do some really exciting things. The cool thing about Remix is that you can start and ship the simple implementation and then incrementally add more complexity to it over time without completely rearchitecting your solution or changing your mental model. And that's what we'll be doing in this workshop. All while keep your app fast and bug-free–just the way your users like it.</p>
                                <p>At the end of this workshop, you'll know how to:</p>
                                <p>Eliminate busy indicators with Optimistic UI (while still handling errors)</p>
                                <p>Optimize Remix's automatic data revalidation after mutations</p>
                                <p>Fetch data outside of navigations for data driven components like Combobox/Autocomplete</p>
                                <p>Build global, animated navigation indicators, aware of submissions, revalidation, and redirects</p>
                                <p>Step up your app's accessibility with focus management</p>
                                <p>Make imperative data mutations (for things like mutations on keyboard shortcuts)</p>
