Makepad applications can be very small, on the order of just a few hundred kilobytes for wasm, to a few megabytes with native.

During the presentation, we show how to use Tensorflow.js, Keras and React Native to build a solution that can recognize skin moles and detect if they are a melanoma or a benign mole. We also show issues that we have faced during development. As a summary, we present the pros and cons of JavaScript used for machine learning projects.&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:&quot;2022-06-20T18:10:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Residents Track&quot;,&quot;isPrimary&quot;:true},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;java-script-beats-cancer&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;karol-przystalski&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} })

For a frontend web application, this is rarely the case. Frontend applications not only need to be resource-efficient, but must also \&quot;\&quot;feel\&quot;\&quot; efficient to the user. This makes performance on the frontend mostly a user experience issue.\n\nJoin me as we take a deep dive into the important performance metrics of a modern frontend app, how to measure them, and how to optimize them for both the machine and the user.&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Community Track Remote&quot;,&quot;isPrimary&quot;:true},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;performance-is-user-experience-optimizing-the-frontend-for-the-users&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;chinenye-onuegbu&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} })

It features a “”Zero-API”\&quot; data layer abstraction, has authn &amp; authz out of the box and a few more exciting features. However, we recently decided to pivot Blitz to a framework agnostic toolkit, which means a huge and thrilling change for the Blitz community.\nDuring this talk, I will introduce the core concepts, talk about the why &amp; how of the pivot, and give you a glimpse of Blitz’s future.&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Community Track Remote&quot;,&quot;isPrimary&quot;:true},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;how-blitz-js-makes-fullstack-web-development-a-breeze&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;aleksandra-sikora&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} })

This session will explain how we start with a single TypeScript version and automatically convert it to every combination we need and finally use Cypress to test the converted example.&quot;,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Community Track Remote&quot;,&quot;isPrimary&quot;:true},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;automatically-maintaining-thousands-of-code-demos-across-multiple-framework-variations&quot;}]},&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;stephen-cooper&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;speaker--undefined&quot;,&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;e981e312fd6c48a39230de9193be4db9&quot;,&quot;contentTypeAlt&quot;:&quot;d31070ab4611456a83fa837a6ccea527&quot;} })

                  <p>Who says that JavaScript is only for serious business? You can actually power an entire party by JS, and JSNation will show you how.</p>
                  <p>Amsterdam is known for its nightlife and all our attendees get an invitation to join in. If you get full access, you'll get to see various kinds of performances made with JS at the biggest JS party worldwide on June 17. </p>
                  <p>Aside from that, the extended program for in-person attendees will also offer a karaoke party and silent disco with music for everyone playing on 3 channels. So come hang out with your fellow devs in Amsterdam! Afterwards, on June 18, we'll explore the capital of the Netherlands together at walking tours and boat tours.</p>
