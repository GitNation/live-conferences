            "description": "<p>Native ESM support for Node.js was a chance for the Node.js project to release official support for enhancing the module loading experience, to enable use cases such as on the fly transpilation, module stubbing, support for loading modules from HTTP, and monitoring.</p>\n<p>While CommonJS has support for all this, it was never officially supported and was done by hacking into the Node.js runtime code. ESM has fixed all this. We will look at the architecture of ESM loading in Node.js, and discuss the loader API that supports enhancing it. We will also look into advanced features such as loader chaining and off thread execution.</p>\n",

There is no one thing, but rather a death by thousand cuts. Developers are under pressure, and they often choose the easy and quick path to deliver a feature rather than the performant path.

Signals offer a powerful set of primitives that ensure that your UI is in sync with your state independent of components. A universal language for the frontend user interface.</p><p><br /></p><p>But what about Async? How do we manage to orchestrate data loading and mutation, server rendering, and streaming?

                "description": "<p>Bun, Deno, and many other JavaScript runtimes have been hype, but do you know why? Is it that easy to make a runtime from scratch?</p><p><br /></p><p>I've been researching the secret behind Node.js' power and why there are so many new JavaScript runtimes coming up. Breaking down each key component used on Node.js I've come to interesting conclusions that many people used to say whereas in practice it works a bit differently.</p><p><br /></p><p>In this talk, attendees will learn the concepts used to create a new JavaScript runtime. They're going to go through an example of how to make a JavaScript runtime by following what's behind the scenes on the Node.js project using C++. They'll learn the relationship between Chrome's V8 and Libuv and what makes one JavaScript runtime better than others.</p>\n",

Let's demystify the secret art of JavaScript tools, how they work, and how to build our own. We'll discover the opportunities in our everyday work to apply these techniques, writing our own ESLint rules to prevent mistakes and code transforms to make breaking changes easy to apply. We’ll walk through the fundamentals of working with an abstract syntax tree, and develop our understanding through a live-code.
