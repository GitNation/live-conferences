                "description": "The golden rule of web performance states that for most web pages, less than 10–20% of the end user response time is spent getting the HTML document from the web server to the browser while 80-90% of the end user response time is spent on the frontend.\n\nWhen we talk about performance testing, the most common activity that we do is to load test our backend servers. We come to a realisation that once we have optimised our servers and databases, that our application is now performant. However, this should not be the case. Just because our servers have returned the response to a specific request doesn't mean that our users can see the response on the web page yet. There are many factors affecting frontend performance as well and it's as equally important to test to make sure that our users have the best user experience.\n\nHistorically, when we think of frontend and backend performance, we have to use separate tools. But what if there is one tool that can do this both?\n\nIn this talk, I want to introduce you to both frontend and backend performance testing and why a medley of these testing activities are needed to make sure that your website is performant. I'll also give a quick walkthrough as to how tools such as xk6-browser can help with running both protocol-level (how performance testing is normally run through concurrent interactions at the protocol layer) and browser-level tests (testing with real browsers to provide a more realistic performance test).\n\nBy the end of this talk, you should be equipped with new knowledge regarding frontend and backend performance testing which you can apply to your work projects.",

The person behind BlogGeek.me and Chief Product Officer at Spearline.\nMy blog focuses on rumblings about technology usually boiling down to WebRTC, CPaaS, Messaging, Disruption and other topics (Science Fiction anyone?) To put food on the table, I also consult in these domains, publish my own reports and run a WebRTC training.</p>\n<p>During the past decade (and then some) I have taken part in the development of various telecommunication projects - mainly those related to VoIP and 3G. I've done so as a programmer, manager, marketer and CTO. This included developing the 3G-324M protocol stack from scratch, as well as managing the team that was in charge of developing and maintaining the H.323 protocol stack, along with other interesting projects.</p>\n<p>I was the cofounder and CEO of testRTC, a self service SaaS company focused on testing, monitoring and support for WebRTC applications. In 2021, we sold the company to Spearline.</p>\n<p>These days I am working as a consultant, analyst and entrepreneur on anything related to VoIP, but it mainly focuses on CPaaS, WebRTC and their potential for disruption.</p>\n<p>I have an MSc in Computer Science and an MBA degree with a focus in Entrepreneurship and Strategy. Included in my resume are a few patents and being the chairman of different activity groups in the IMTC – an organization focused on interoperability of multimedia standards.</p>\n<p>You can use the social media links to reach me or learn more about what I do and where.</p>\n",

                "description": "Modern distributed architectures are more complex than ever before, with a majority of companies operating multiple languages, protocols and architectural styles. This poses significant challenges for engineering teams increasingly asked to deliver more at speed. Whilst the practice of contract testing rose to prominence during the RESTful microservices boom to address similar challenges, the problem statement has evolved. In this talk, we'll discuss these new challenges and demonstrate how contract testing is still as relevant as it has ever been in helping to solve them.",

They’re tiny in size but large in their impact.\nThis tutorial will teach you how to create atomic e2e tests with several code examples. First, we will use Cypress.io to authenticate by setting a cookie. Instead of using a UI. Second, we will use Cypress.io to set a JSON Web Token for authentication.\nJoin me, and let’s write tiny tests for large results.",
