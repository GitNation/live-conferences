I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.",

While there, my Creative Director warned me to never let anyone find out I could code, because if I did I'd be stuck doing it forever. I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.",

I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier.

After more than 12 years working as a developer, creating products and projects for different organizations and clients, he thought it would be great to combine those three interests in some way. In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course). He is one of the organizers of React Buenos Aires, the biggest React community in Argentina. He has been selected Prisma Ambassador, Auth0 Ambassador, and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.",

In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course). He is one of the organizers of React Buenos Aires, the biggest React community in Argentina. He has been selected Prisma Ambassador, Auth0 Ambassador, and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.",

The new react.dev launched this year introducing new methodologies like challenges and interactive sandboxes and subtle inclusivity features, like \"international tone\" and culturally agnostic examples. Not only have the new docs changed how people learn React, they've inspired how we think about developer education as a community. In this talk, you will learn how the React team and some ambitious community members made the \"React docs rock\" for a generation of front end developers and how these new patterns and established techniques can be applied in your favorite projects.</p>\n",

I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier.

After more than 12 years working as a developer, creating products and projects for different organizations and clients, he thought it would be great to combine those three interests in some way. In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations.

                    <p>Among the different things that Facundo enjoys, some of them are meeting and connecting with other people, web development, and talking a lot. After more than 12 years working as a developer, creating products and projects for different organizations and clients, he thought it would be great to combine those three interests in some way. In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course).

                    <p>Hi, I’m Josh! I’m an independent full time open source developer. I work on projects in the TypeScript ecosystem, most notably typescript-eslint: the tooling that enables ESLint and Prettier to run on TypeScript code. I’m also the author of the O’Reilly Learning TypeScript book, a Microsoft MVP for developer technologies, and an active conference speaker. My personal projects range from static analysis to meta-languages to recreating retro games in the browser. Also cats.</p>

Just stick around. Being a true senior takes a new way of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;re a great engineer. You can code anything you need, solve every problem, google any solution. Your code is flying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But somehow you&#39;re ... stuck. Interviewing feels rough, you pass the coding and fail the real stuff. Culture and system. At work they keep giving you stupid little problems with no growth. You crave challenge and keep tweaking CSS instead. You want some responsibility, damn it! What&#39;s that coworker got that you don&#39;t? Most of all you crave autonomy. The freedom to tackle big challenges and help the company with your brilliance. They don&#39;t even see all the bad code you see! How can they live like this?? Instead of autonomy, you&#39;re getting babysat. Managers asking what you&#39;re up to, daily standups that feel like a drag, pushback and &#39;maybe someday&#39; on every idea that you give. I was like that a few years ago. A totally senior engineer who keeps running into walls and getting stuck. Now even bigger companies trust me with designing systems and leading teams on projects that could make or break the company. In this workshop you&#39;ll learn what changed and how to apply the Senior Mindset to your work and career:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;How to gain autonomy&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Inspire trust&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Own large projects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Get freedom to experiment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Have your ideas heard&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Think like an expert&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Become a decision-making peer, not a pair of hands&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll work on case studies, analyze anecdotes, discuss insightful books, and look at your work and career in a new light.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;November 14, 9:00-18:00 EST.

This workshop will provide a deep dive into the language, and basic TypeScript knowledge is assumed. We will briefly discuss the design philosophy of TypeScript, and then cover all the lesser-known or harder features. That is: do all the cool and weird meta programming stuff (TS is turing complete!) and learn the tricks you won&#39;t find in the handbook.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So join if you feel like you&#39;re writing too much type annotations to make TypeScript happy! We&#39;ll dive deep into how type inference and control flows works, and how you can make the compiler work for you. We&#39;ll discuss all the fancier language constructs like:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ReturnType&amp;#x3C;&gt;, Parameters&amp;#x3C;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;typeof, keyof&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Mapped types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;ConditionalTypes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Function overloading&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Discrimination unions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Type guards and type assertions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;String template types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;(Variadic) tuple types&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: December 14&amp;#x26;15, 10:00am-02:00pm EST.

Do your users want to be able to search, sort, filter, and edit data? AG Grid is the best JavaScript grid in the world and is packed with features, highly performant, and extensible. In this workshop, you’ll learn how to get started with AG Grid, how we can enable sorting and filtering of data in the grid, cell rendering, and more. You will walk away from this free 3-hour workshop equipped with the knowledge for implementing AG Grid into your React application.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We all know that rolling our own grid solution is not easy, and let&#39;s be honest, is not something that we should be working on.

But how do you know which ones? How do you go from an idea into a functioning product that can be put into the hands of paying customers without quitting your job and sinking all of your time and investment into it? How can your solo side-projects compete with applications built by enormous teams and large enterprise companies?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Building rich SaaS products comes with technical challenges like infrastructure, scaling, availability, security, and complicated subsystems like auth and payments. This is why it’s often the already established tech giants who can reasonably build and operate products like that. However, a new generation of devtools are enabling us developers to easily build complete solutions that take advantage of the best cloud infrastructure available, and offer an experience that allows you to rapidly iterate on your ideas for a low cost of $0. They take all the technical challenges of building and operating software products away from you so that you only have to spend your time building the features that your users want, giving you a reasonable chance to compete against the market by staying incredibly agile and responsive to the needs of users.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this 3 hour workshop you will start with a simple task management application built with React and Next.js and turn it into a scalable and fully functioning SaaS product by integrating a scalable database (PlanetScale), multi-tenant authentication (Clerk), and subscription based payments (Stripe). You will also learn how the principles of agile software development and domain driven design can help you build products quickly and cost-efficiently, and compete with existing solutions.\&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Some experience with React, Next.js, and Prisma (or any similar ORM). You will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://git-scm.com/\&quot;&gt;Git SCM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://nodejs.org/en\&quot;&gt;Node.js LTS (v18.x)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli\&quot;&gt;Stripe CLI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;Intermediate&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;November 9, Time: 11:00-14:00 ET, Remote&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;slogan&quot;:null,&quot;code&quot;:null,&quot;workshopExtensions&quot;:[{&quot;isoDate&quot;:&quot;2023-11-09T10:00:00+00:00&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;November 9, Time: 11:00-14:00 ET, Remote&quot;,&quot;includedToPackage&quot;:true,&quot;extension&quot;:null}],&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;2ce17eb4016e4be5ae72bb0db484f3f0&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2023-11-13T06:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;dateString&quot;:&quot;November 13&quot;,&quot;startingTime&quot;:&quot;06:00&quot;,&quot;schedule&quot;:{&quot;starting&quot;:&quot;6:00&quot;,&quot;ending&quot;:&quot;9:00&quot;},&quot;trainersTitle&quot;:&quot;Dev Agrawal&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;from-todo-app-to-b2b-saa-s-with-next-js-and-clerk&quot;,&quot;isoDate&quot;:&quot;2023-11-09T10:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;includedToPackage&quot;:true,&quot;finishingTime&quot;:&quot;&quot;} })

He is primarily focused on Cloudflare Pages, a platform for developers who want to build full-stack, affordable, and globally scalable applications. He spends a lot of time thinking about the experience for Pages&#39; developers, but also (and maybe more importantly) the experience for their end-users. How can applications, frameworks, and platforms all work together to produce the most performant, most accessible, and most delightful experience for users, regardless of where they are, what device they&#39;re using, or what internet connection they have.  &quot;,&quot;githubUrl&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/GregBrimble&quot;,&quot;portalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://portal.gitnation.org/person/greg_brimble&quot;,&quot;twitterUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/GregBrimble&quot;,&quot;mediumUrl&quot;:null,&quot;ownSite&quot;:&quot;https://gregbrimble.com/&quot;,&quot;avatar&quot;:{&quot;handle&quot;:&quot;LfnqueuBQS2F9EXozSn2&quot;,&quot;mimeType&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://media.graphassets.com/resize=fit:crop,height:500,width:500/output=format:jpg/LfnqueuBQS2F9EXozSn2&quot;},&quot;lightningTalks&quot;:[],&quot;talks&quot;:[],&quot;workshops&quot;:[],&quot;workshopsActivity&quot;:[{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Advanced Application Deployment Patterns with React Server Components (feat. a DIY RSC Framework)&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;advanced-application-deployment-patterns-with-react-server-components-feat-a-diy-rsc-framework&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:null}],&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;greg-brimble&quot;}],&quot;id&quot;:&quot;clnood0p1uh9w0atei235nbtd&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Advanced Application Deployment Patterns with React Server Components (feat. a DIY RSC Framework)&quot;,&quot;toc&quot;:[],&quot;duration&quot;:&quot;3&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The developer ecosystem is always moving fast and this year has proved no exception. React Server Components can offer a significant improvement to developer experience and to application performance. But I think it&#39;s fair to say that this new server-first paradigm can be tricky to wrap your head around!\nIn the first half of this workshop, we&#39;ll explore React Server Components from the ground-up: building our own mini meta-framework to help us understand how RSCs work. We&#39;ll discover exactly what is produced by an RSC build and we&#39;ll connect those pieces together to form a full application.\nNext, we&#39;ll deploy it! Cloudflare have also had a busy year too — Smart Placement, in particular, is a new technology that we&#39;ve developed which fits the RSC model perfectly. We&#39;ll explore why that makes sense for our workshop app, and we&#39;ll actually deploy it onto the Cloudflare Developer Platform.\nFinally, we&#39;ll build out our app a little further, using D1 (our serverless SQL database) to really show off the React Server Component&#39;s power when combined with Smart Placement.\nYou should come away from this workshop with a greater understanding of how React Server Components work (both behind-the-scenes and also how you as a developer can use them day-to-day), as well as insight into some of the new deployment patterns that are now possible after recent innovations in the platform space.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;Advanced&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;November 14, Time: 11:00-14:00 ET&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;slogan&quot;:null,&quot;code&quot;:null,&quot;workshopExtensions&quot;:[{&quot;isoDate&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;November 14, Time: 11:00-14:00 ET&quot;,&quot;includedToPackage&quot;:true,&quot;extension&quot;:null}],&quot;contentType&quot;:&quot;2ce17eb4016e4be5ae72bb0db484f3f0&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2023-11-13T06:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;dateString&quot;:&quot;November 13&quot;,&quot;startingTime&quot;:&quot;06:00&quot;,&quot;schedule&quot;:{&quot;starting&quot;:&quot;6:00&quot;,&quot;ending&quot;:&quot;9:00&quot;},&quot;trainersTitle&quot;:&quot;Greg Brimble &quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;advanced-application-deployment-patterns-with-react-server-components-feat-a-diy-rsc-framework&quot;,&quot;isoDate&quot;:null,&quot;includedToPackage&quot;:true,&quot;finishingTime&quot;:&quot;&quot;} })
