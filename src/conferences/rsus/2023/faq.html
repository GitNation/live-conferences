After more than 12 years working as a developer, creating products and projects for different organizations and clients, he thought it would be great to combine those three interests in some way. In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course). He is one of the organizers of React Buenos Aires, the biggest React community in Argentina. He has been selected Prisma Ambassador, Auth0 Ambassador, and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.</p>\n",

Working through the trade-offs of these approaches will give us new insights into React rendering and hints on how we can optimise our applications.",

After more than 12 years working as a developer, creating products and projects for different organizations and clients, he thought it would be great to combine those three interests in some way. In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course). He is one of the organizers of React Buenos Aires, the biggest React community in Argentina. He has been selected Prisma Ambassador, Auth0 Ambassador, and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.",

If you visit that site, would you be able to tell it's built using React Native just by looking and using it?<br /><br />At a high level, Taz talks about what makes that possible and how the audience should consider application architecture.<br /><br />At a lower level, Taz focuses on:<br />- How React's component composition model makes accommodating multiple platforms easy<br />- How large applications should use a Design System, and the Tamagui Design System comes with an optimizing compiler that outputs straight platform-specific code while the developer still writes high-level UI that happens to utilize React Native's components<br />- How to Server-Side Render a React Native Web application, and what considerations Guild made when choosing to create a custom SSR engine on top of Cloudflare Workers<br />- In order for Guild to exist anywhere, they need to embed themselves into other experiences. This involves Third-Party React Native on the Web and other platforms<br />- The future of this architecture, where Third-Party UI is the same as First-Party UI</span></p>\n",

After more than 12 years working as a developer, creating products and projects for different organizations and clients, he thought it would be great to combine those three interests in some way. In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course). He is one of the organizers of React Buenos Aires, the biggest React community in Argentina. He has been selected Prisma Ambassador, Auth0 Ambassador, and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.",

I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier.

While there, my Creative Director warned me to never let anyone find out I could code, because if I did I'd be stuck doing it forever. I ignored his warning; it turns out he was completely right, but I've never been happier. I currently work as a developer advocate on a wonderful team where I help people build web applications in React, design and maintain their UI component libraries, and desperately attempt to stop back-end devs from writing any more CSS.",
