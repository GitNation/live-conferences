                    "description": "<p>Vite is an essential tool for modern front-end development. We use it daily, but we know little about its inner workings. We write  .jsx or .vue files, but how do they get transpiled into .js files? There's likely some magic behind Vite's plugins, but how do they work?<br /><br />In this talk, we'll start by creating a simple plugin and progress to more advanced ones. After this session, you'll understand how Vite plugins work and the overall flow, even without prior knowledge of Vite plugins.<br /><br />With this new knowledge, you can perform computations during the build process that don't necessarily occur at runtime. This can naturally result in faster runtime performance.

                    "description": "<p>Accessibility is no longer an option; it’s a mandatory requirement for successful product launches. While we can implement basic accessibility features using ARIA roles and properties in React components, real-world scenarios present additional complexities. When focusing on elements like the Contrast setting slider, how do we read menu names, selected values, and hints in TV interfaces? How do we read only changed values afterward? In this talk, I’ll share practical insights from our experience in making React components accessible for tens of millions of webOS TVs annually.</p>\n",

Guided by a design education, he's held roles across creative agencies and e-commerce platforms, married design fidelity with developer experience building component libraries for design systems, and built tools for front-end developers as an early hire at CodePen. Jake loves to walk the line between design and code, bridge gaps in communication across product development, and bring as much fun and creativity to the work that he can manage to cram in along the way.",

Guided by a design education, he's held roles across creative agencies and e-commerce platforms, married design fidelity with developer experience building component libraries for design systems, and built tools for front-end developers as an early hire at CodePen. Jake loves to walk the line between design and code, bridge gaps in communication across product development, and bring as much fun and creativity to the work that he can manage to cram in along the way.",

If you have any ideas, email him!\n\nTom got into software engineering as a kid, and it's a passion that never left.

He also spends a lot of time talking with developers in order to better understand how to make Convex the fastest, most reliable and easy-to-use development platform on the planet. If you have any ideas, email him!\n\nTom got into software engineering as a kid, and it's a passion that never left. His free time is spent reading programming books (no joke), and playing covers of 90s pop songs on his guitar while singing extremely loudly and beautifully.",

By reducing backend complexity, developers can prioritize building dynamic, data-rich UIs without the hassle of managing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;,&quot;dayISO&quot;:&quot;2024-11-19T00:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:&quot;Summit Track&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;simplifying-analytics-in-react-apps&quot;,&quot;isLightning&quot;:true,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;tooling&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;talk--undefined&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:[{&quot;label&quot;:&quot;tooling&quot;,&quot;colour&quot;:null}],&quot;speakers&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:131041,&quot;website&quot;:null,&quot;github&quot;:null,&quot;twitter&quot;:null,&quot;linkedin&quot;:&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-robb-profile/&quot;,&quot;instagram&quot;:null,&quot;tiktok&quot;:null,&quot;avatar&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.imgix.net/stichting-frontend-amsterdam/image/upload/v1728242532/Stephen_Robb_c6smju.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=300&amp;h=300&quot;,&quot;shortBio&quot;:null,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;Sisense&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;USA&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Stephen Robb&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;stephen_robb&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Experienced sales engineering leader with an extensive background in project management, data analytics, BI, data science and a wide range of software skills.

Guided by a design education, he&#39;s held roles across creative agencies and e-commerce platforms, married design fidelity with developer experience building component libraries for design systems, and built tools for front-end developers as an early hire at CodePen. Jake loves to walk the line between design and code, bridge gaps in communication across product development, and bring as much fun and creativity to the work that he can manage to cram in along the way.&quot;,&quot;githubUrl&quot;:&quot;github.com/jake-figma&quot;,&quot;twitterUrl&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/biznissjake&quot;,&quot;portalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/jake_albaugh&quot;,&quot;ownSite&quot;:null,&quot;socials&quot;:[{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;github.com/jake-figma&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;gh&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/jake_albaugh&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;portal&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/biznissjake&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;tw&quot;}]}],&quot;subactivities&quot;:[]}]} });

He also spends a lot of time talking with developers in order to better understand how to make Convex the fastest, most reliable and easy-to-use development platform on the planet. If you have any ideas, email him!\n\nTom got into software engineering as a kid, and it&#39;s a passion that never left. His free time is spent reading programming books (no joke), and playing covers of 90s pop songs on his guitar while singing extremely loudly and beautifully.&quot;,&quot;githubUrl&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/tomredman&quot;,&quot;twitterUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/redman&quot;,&quot;portalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/tom_redman&quot;,&quot;ownSite&quot;:null,&quot;socials&quot;:[{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/tomredman&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;gh&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/tom_redman&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;portal&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/redman&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;tw&quot;}]}],&quot;subactivities&quot;:[]} });

If you have any ideas, email him!\n\nTom got into software engineering as a kid, and it&#39;s a passion that never left.

I firmly believe technology can be used to create a more inclusive and equitable world as long as we keep it in check.&quot;,&quot;githubUrl&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/catandthemachines&quot;,&quot;twitterUrl&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/cat_themachines&quot;,&quot;portalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/catherine_johnson&quot;,&quot;ownSite&quot;:&quot;https://catandthemachines.com&quot;,&quot;socials&quot;:[{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/catandthemachines&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;gh&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.com/person/catherine_johnson&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;portal&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://x.com/cat_themachines&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;tw&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://catandthemachines.com&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;site&quot;}]},{&quot;id&quot;:39716,&quot;website&quot;:&quot;https://anthonyalicea.com&quot;,&quot;github&quot;:null,&quot;twitter&quot;:&quot;anthonypalicea&quot;,&quot;linkedin&quot;:null,&quot;instagram&quot;:null,&quot;tiktok&quot;:null,&quot;avatar&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.imgix.net/stichting-frontend-amsterdam/image/upload/v1691579663/TonyAlicea_Headshot3_vtryh3.jpg?auto=format,compress&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=300&amp;h=300&quot;,&quot;shortBio&quot;:&quot;Tony is a bestselling Udemy and Pluralsight author, known for his online courses such as \&quot;JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts\&quot;&quot;,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;The Smyth Group&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;USA&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Tony Alicea&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;tony_alicea&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Tony is a bestselling Udemy and Pluralsight author, known for his online courses such as \&quot;JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts\&quot;, in which he focuses on teaching web and computer science fundamentals.
