He also spends a lot of time talking with developers in order to better understand how to make Convex the fastest, most reliable and easy-to-use development platform on the planet. If you have any ideas, email him!\n\nTom got into software engineering as a kid, and it's a passion that never left. His free time is spent reading programming books (no joke), and playing covers of 90s pop songs on his guitar while singing extremely loudly and beautifully.",

Guided by a design education, he's held roles across creative agencies and e-commerce platforms, married design fidelity with developer experience building component libraries for design systems, and built tools for front-end developers as an early hire at CodePen. Jake loves to walk the line between design and code, bridge gaps in communication across product development, and bring as much fun and creativity to the work that he can manage to cram in along the way.",

The talk will begin by covering the foundational concepts of creative coding, guiding participants through the essentials needed to create sketches and manipulate visuals using JavaScript. From there, we’ll explore how p5.js can be seamlessly integrated into a React environment, unlocking the ability to combine React’s declarative power with the creative potential of p5.js. By the end of the session, attendees will not only have a solid grasp of how to get started with p5.js and React but will also feel empowered to embark on their own creative coding experiments, applying these tools to build immersive, interactive web experiences.</p>\n",

                    <h3>Building Your Own GenAI Agent Application</h3>
                    <p>GenAI agents are one of the most promising directions for complex GenAI based applications. These agents can search the web, code, and carry complex tasks completely autonomously for the user. </p>
                    <p>In this workshop we will learn the basics of GenAI agents. Define the basic terms and frameworks and understand how they differ from traditional use of LLMs.</p>
                    <p>We will understand prompting techniques for LLM agents and specifically the React prompting technique for AI agents (not to be confused with React the programming language). </p>
                    <p>We will build, from scratch, our own GenAI agent that can interact with the user, perform web searches and code and execute in Javascript.</p>
                    <p>Table of contents:</p>
                    <p>- Introduction to GenAI agents</p>
                    <p>- Understanding the React framework</p>
                    <p>- Hands-on Building of simple GenAI agent</p>
                    <p>- Deployment of the Agent with streamlit</p>

                    <h3>Deploy and Test Full-Stack React Apps on Cloudflare</h3>
                    <p>This 3 hour workshop will provide an introduction to the Cloudflare Developer Platform for application developers. It will focus on developing a full-stack React application backed by tests that can guarantee the correctness of its interactions with the resources and APIs provided by the Developer Platform.</p>
                    <p>The workshop assumes basic knowledge of TypeScript and React — not much beyond what’s needed to build a hello world app in React using TypeScript! Knowledge of the Developer Platform is also not required as everything Cloudflare related will be introduced as part of the workshop.</p>
                    <p>So if you’re interested in application development on the (fast and inexpensive!) Cloudflare platform then this workshop is for you. By the end of it you will know how to build a fully-fledged, fully-tested, full-stack web application (using React or any framework of your choice) with a comprehensive testing structure that gives you full confidence and peace of mind.</p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <p><strong>Agenda</strong></p>
                    <p>The workshop will include live coding, Q&amp;A, and interactive coding sections. The starting code, alongside instructions will be also made available for participants to revisit and dig deeper after</p>
                    <p>the workshop.</p>
                    <p>As part of the initial setup we’ll see how to use the <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/c3/" target="_blank">C3</a> tool to easily deploy applications to Cloudflare in a matter of minutes.</p>
                    <p>Afterwards, we will see how to write code that interacts with the Developer Platform specific resources and APIs, specifically, we’ll use <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv" target="_blank">KVs</a>, R2 buckets and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai" target="_blank">Workers AI</a>. We’ll also make sure to test all the code to make sure that it correctly interacts with the aforementioned APIs via the official <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/vitest-integration/" target="_blank">Workers Vitest integration</a>.</p>
                    <p>We will then integrate the Workers code with our React app to build a complete full-stack application ready to be deployed to the Cloudflare edge network. We will use <a href="https://playwright.dev/" target="_blank">playwright</a> to implement an end-to-end (e2e) suite of tests to make sure that the application integrates perfectly with the Cloudflare platform.</p>
                    <p><br /></p>
                    <p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
                    <p>- How to develop on the Cloudflare Workers runtime and interact with various Cloudflare resources</p>

                    <p>Learn how to handle forms in React using the latest features, such as startTransition, useTransition, useOptimistic, and useActionState, with and without React 19 server actions, alongside proper validation, error handling, and best practices.</p>
                    <p>The workshop will begin by demonstrating traditional form handling using useState and useEffect for client-side rendering. Gradually, we'll transition to using the latest React 19 features, including server-side forms and the newest hooks for managing form states and errors. By the end of the workshop, participants will understand how to create robust forms with proper validation and error handling.</p>
