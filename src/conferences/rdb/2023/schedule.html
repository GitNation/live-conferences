For the most recent updates, please see <a href=\"https://covidvax.live/location/deu\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Travel Regulations for Foreigners</h3>\n<p>For entry into Germany, proof of vaccination, proof of convalescence or proof of testing is no longer required. For the most recent updates, please see <a href=\"https://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/en/coronavirus/2317268#:~:text=Due%20to%20the%20COVID%2D19,areas%20have%20been%20mostly%20lifted\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that does not hold for countries in the red zone.

Please see the website of your travel providers for more information.</p>\n<h3>Covid Policy</h3>\n<p>Our corona policy is in line with the government guidelines. This year we won’t be screening for temperature or checking proof of vaccination or recent negative test (PCR or rapid test). </p>\n<p>But we’re asking you to be responsible: if you have any symptoms or have been in contact with someone tested positive recently, please choose remote participation and watch the conference online, to ensure other attendees' safety.\nIt would be respectful to other attendees that attending people have either vaccination or recent PCR/rapid test, although this won't be enforced.\nIf you feel vulnerable at an event full of other people around you, you are welcome to wear masks, and we can provide them of course.</p>\n<p><strong>We provide the following measures at the in-person part of the event:</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sanitizer dispenser stations will be available inside the venue.</li>\n<li>Bathrooms cleaned frequently.</li>\n<li>Masks are optional and will be offered at the registration desk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Refund Policy</h3>\n<p>We understand that along the way, there might be obstacles for some attendees, as the situation with Covid’19 can always change. That’s why we can offer you several options for different cases:</p>\n<p><strong>Case 1</strong> : If an in-person ticket holder is not able to enter the UK due to Covid’s recent restrictions and informs us 14 days before the conference date - we can offer ticket transfer, downgrade to remote or refund.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 2</strong> : If an in-person ticket holder is not able to enter the UK due to Covid’s recent restrictions and informs us less than 14 days before the conference date - we can offer downgrade the ticket to remote and credits for 1-year GitNation Multipass, providing access to 10 additional remote events and dozens of talk &#x26; workshop recordings from our past conferences, or ticket transfer.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 3</strong> : If the in-person part of the event is cancelled due to the worsening situation with Covid, the whole event will be held online - all in-person ticket holders will receive a full remote ticket and the option of choosing between a 2-year GitNation Multipass, providing access to 20 additional remote events and tens of talk &#x26; workshop recordings from our past conferences, or a PRO remote workshop. We can also offer the opportunity to transfer your ticket to another future GitNation conference.</p>\n<p>When requesting a refund or changing the ticket type, please contact us via <a href=\"events@gitnation.org\">events@gitnation.org</a>. </p>\n",

By making UI Config driven we supercharged React components by making config file a single source of truth, The above approach made it easier to onboard new UI scenarios quickly and with minimal regression in the old UI Flows, resulting in a significant reduction in dev efforts, the best part is all the code was kept in Typescript only no XML or other declarative languages were used.</p>\n",

I thought it was for browser!<br /><br />In this talk, we'll explore the benefits of using low-level languages on the server-side, and the different possibilities that WebAssembly provides for building high-performance web applications. We'll dive into different providers for WebAssembly functions, as well as practical use cases for integrating WebAssembly with React.<br /><br />By the end of this talk, you'll walk away with a deeper understanding of how server-side WebAssembly and React can be used together. You'll also gain practical insights into how to use low-level languages on the server-side, and tips for overcoming common challenges when integrating WebAssembly with React.</span></p>\n",

In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations.

After more than 12 years working as a developer, creating products and projects for different organizations and clients, he thought it would be great to combine those three interests in some way. In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course). He is one of the organizers of React Buenos Aires, the biggest React community in Argentina. He has been selected Prisma Ambassador, Auth0 Ambassador, and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.",

And what&#39;s the deal with JSX.Element?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll walk away with a bunch of exciting ideas to take to your React applications, and hopefully a new appreciation for the wonders of React and TypeScript working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;dayISO&quot;:&quot;2023-12-12T00:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:&quot;useReducer Track&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;react-s-most-useful-types&quot;,&quot;isLightning&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;typescript&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;talk--undefined&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:[{&quot;label&quot;:&quot;typescript&quot;,&quot;colour&quot;:null}],&quot;speakers&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:3140,&quot;website&quot;:&quot;https://www.totaltypescript.com/&quot;,&quot;github&quot;:&quot;mattpocock&quot;,&quot;twitter&quot;:&quot;mattpocockuk&quot;,&quot;linkedin&quot;:null,&quot;instagram&quot;:null,&quot;avatar&quot;:&quot;https://gitnation.imgix.net/stichting-frontend-amsterdam/image/upload/f_auto,c_fill,w_300,h_300/v1630345701/ojmqvhaxcj8w25yrk65e.jpg?auto=format&quot;,&quot;shortBio&quot;:null,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;Independent&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;UK&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Matt Pocock&quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;matt_pocock&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Matt is an independent TypeScript educator, building awesome self-paced courses at Total TypeScript.&quot;,&quot;githubUrl&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/mattpocock&quot;,&quot;twitterUrl&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk&quot;,&quot;portalUrl&quot;:&quot;https://portal.gitnation.org/person/matt_pocock&quot;,&quot;ownSite&quot;:&quot;https://totaltypescript.com&quot;,&quot;socials&quot;:[{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/mattpocock&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;gh&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://portal.gitnation.org/person/matt_pocock&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;portal&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/mattpocockuk&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;tw&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://totaltypescript.com&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;site&quot;}]}],&quot;subactivities&quot;:[]} });

This talk will explore the basics of heap profiling, moving on to more advanced tools and techniques for analysing memory usage in your React application, including how to profile it in your CI pipeline and answer your own optimisation questions by writing custom heap analyzers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;dayISO&quot;:&quot;2023-12-12T00:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:&quot;useReducer Track&quot;,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;how-much-ram-is-your-use-memo-using-let-s-profile-it&quot;,&quot;isLightning&quot;:false,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;performance&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;talk--undefined&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:[{&quot;label&quot;:&quot;performance&quot;,&quot;colour&quot;:null}],&quot;speakers&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:28683,&quot;website&quot;:&quot;https://giuliozausa.dev&quot;,&quot;github&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/giulioz&quot;,&quot;twitter&quot;:&quot;giuliozausa&quot;,&quot;linkedin&quot;:null,&quot;instagram&quot;:null,&quot;avatar&quot;:&quot;https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1353142?v=4&quot;,&quot;shortBio&quot;:null,&quot;company&quot;:&quot;Flux.ai&quot;,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;Austria&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Giulio Zausa‮ &quot;,&quot;nickname&quot;:&quot;giulio_zausa&quot;,&quot;bio&quot;:&quot;Giulio is an Italian software engineer working at Flux and contributing to open source with Poimandres.

Ultimately, its value lies in the problems it solves and the needs it meets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I’ll explore how to apply product thinking principles to your design system, interweaving examples from my own experience as a design system engineering lead.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;design systems&quot;,&quot;track&quot;:{&quot;name&quot;:&quot;useMemo Track&quot;},&quot;timeString&quot;:&quot;2023-12-12T17:06:00.000Z&quot;}]}} });
