For the most recent updates, please see <a href=\"https://covidvax.live/location/deu\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3>Travel Regulations for Foreigners</h3>\n<p>For entry into Germany, proof of vaccination, proof of convalescence or proof of testing is no longer required.

Please see the website of your travel providers for more information.</p>\n<h3>Covid Policy</h3>\n<p>Our corona policy is in line with the government guidelines. This year we won’t be screening for temperature or checking proof of vaccination or recent negative test (PCR or rapid test). </p>\n<p>But we’re asking you to be responsible: if you have any symptoms or have been in contact with someone tested positive recently, please choose remote participation and watch the conference online, to ensure other attendees' safety.\nIt would be respectful to other attendees that attending people have either vaccination or recent PCR/rapid test, although this won't be enforced.\nIf you feel vulnerable at an event full of other people around you, you are welcome to wear masks, and we can provide them of course.</p>\n<p><strong>We provide the following measures at the in-person part of the event:</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sanitizer dispenser stations will be available inside the venue.</li>\n<li>Bathrooms cleaned frequently.</li>\n<li>Masks are optional and will be offered at the registration desk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Refund Policy</h3>\n<p>We understand that along the way, there might be obstacles for some attendees, as the situation with Covid’19 can always change. That’s why we can offer you several options for different cases:</p>\n<p><strong>Case 1</strong> : If an in-person ticket holder is not able to enter the UK due to Covid’s recent restrictions and informs us 14 days before the conference date - we can offer ticket transfer, downgrade to remote or refund.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 2</strong> : If an in-person ticket holder is not able to enter the UK due to Covid’s recent restrictions and informs us less than 14 days before the conference date - we can offer downgrade the ticket to remote and credits for 1-year GitNation Multipass, providing access to 10 additional remote events and dozens of talk &#x26; workshop recordings from our past conferences, or ticket transfer.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 3</strong> : If the in-person part of the event is cancelled due to the worsening situation with Covid, the whole event will be held online - all in-person ticket holders will receive a full remote ticket and the option of choosing between a 2-year GitNation Multipass, providing access to 20 additional remote events and tens of talk &#x26; workshop recordings from our past conferences, or a PRO remote workshop. We can also offer the opportunity to transfer your ticket to another future GitNation conference.</p>\n<p>When requesting a refund or changing the ticket type, please contact us via <a href=\"events@gitnation.org\">events@gitnation.org</a>. </p>\n",

Little did we know how an innocuous release could have triggered a domino effect resulting in failing builds for nearly every React Native developer out there.</p><p><br /></p><p>With the wisdom of hindsight, we'll walk through what happened, what are our lessons learned and the lowlights of this incident. We'll have the opportunity to look through the internals of React Native, discover our incident-response culture, and learn how we're hardening our ecosystem to protect us against similar events in the future.  </p><p><br /></p><p>Join me as we revive this incident, and don't miss this opportunity to gain insights, be inspired, and embrace the lessons learned from the day I broke React Native.</p>\n",

After more than 12 years working as a developer, creating products and projects for different organizations and clients, he thought it would be great to combine those three interests in some way. In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course). He is one of the organizers of React Buenos Aires, the biggest React community in Argentina. He has been selected Prisma Ambassador, Auth0 Ambassador, and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.",

Why? Because there are so many options to consider! Local state, reducers, custom hooks, context, and over a dozen third-party libraries. In this session, we’ll explore the lessons I’ve learned from managing complex state in React over the last seven years. I’ll share my strategy for categorizing React state including local, server, global, derived and many more. After this session, you’ll understand how to identify different types of state, where to declare state, and how to choose between these different options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;best practices&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:0,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;managing-react-state-10-years-of-lessons-learned&quot;}],&quot;offlineTalks&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1881,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Managing React State: 10 Years of Lessons Learned&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Managing React state is hard.

I work on projects in the TypeScript ecosystem, most notably typescript-eslint: the tooling that enables ESLint and Prettier to run on TypeScript code. I’m also the author of the O’Reilly Learning TypeScript book, a Microsoft MVP for developer technologies, and an active conference speaker. My personal projects range from static analysis to meta-languages to recreating retro games in the browser.

As such they pose a significant challenge in development notably in UI. In this talk, we explore how to detect race conditions by leveraging fuzzing techniques. We walk you through discovering the real problem of race conditions and how they impact user experience. We provide you tools and examples demonstrating how to easily detect them in your daily work thanks to tests relying on fuzzing. After that talk, we hope your React code will be race conditions free or at least that you will have the right tools to help you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;testing&quot;,&quot;category&quot;:0,&quot;timeString&quot;:null,&quot;slug&quot;:&quot;break-the-race-easy-race-condition-detection-for-react&quot;}],&quot;offlineTalks&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1643,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Break the Race: Easy Race Condition Detection for React&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Race conditions are among some of the most challenging to detect and reproduce issues.

After more than 12 years working as a developer, creating products and projects for different organizations and clients, he thought it would be great to combine those three interests in some way. In his search of ways to handle that, he discovered the world of Developer Relations. Nowadays, Facundo works as a DevRel Engineer at Storyblok, and he spends his time engaging with the dev community, speaking at events and conferences, creating and sharing content, writing articles for different websites and platforms, leading workshops, and talking (of course). He is one of the organizers of React Buenos Aires, the biggest React community in Argentina. He has been selected Prisma Ambassador, Auth0 Ambassador, and Cloudinary Media Developer Expert.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;socials&quot;:[{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://github.com/fgiuliani&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;gh&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://portal.gitnation.org/person/facundo_giuliani&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;portal&quot;},{&quot;link&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/facundozurdo&quot;,&quot;icon&quot;:&quot;tw&quot;}],&quot;tagBG&quot;:&quot;#3ee5fb&quot;,&quot;color&quot;:&quot;#ffffff&quot;,&quot;activities&quot;:{&quot;talks&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:1995,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Pushing Boundaries to the Edge&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;While the technology goes further and further, web development tries to get closer to the user.

                    <p>Johnny loves (board|electronic) games, programming with a lot of parentheses and cycling and creating Communities on Twitter. After receiving his MSc from Oxford, he went to San Francisco only to be kicked out a year later due to not receiving another visa, he then tried building two startups in Berlin, after which he decided to join another startup in London, only to be relocated to Germany again by 2020, where he now is working remotely, specifically the communities team. In his free time he runs Kronberger Spiele, publishing games since 2003.</p>
