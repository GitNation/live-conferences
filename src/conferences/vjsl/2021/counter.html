This talk will cover the built-in ways Vue.js helps you animate your site, and how for more complicated animations you can hook into third party libraries. It'll also cover the basics of animation itself – what to animate, what not to animate – and how you can use animations to enhance your website without harming the experience of people with disabilities.",

But abstractions work as a spectrum also. We'll look at how we can adjust our view of abstractions and what kind of examples we can use to better understand that abstractions have less to do with programming and more to do with where we deploy.",

That's why we decided to build an integration between Vue Storefront- Lightning-Fast Frontend Platform for Headless Commerce, and Vendure - modern, headless GraphQL-based e-commerce framework. Both tools are built using modern JavaScript stack (Nuxt.js and Nest.js) and have several out of the box integrations like search engines, CMS's, payments, and so on. Also, both projects have a huge community of Open Source contributors who support the development process. In this presentation, I will show you how fast you can create your store with VSF and Vendure.",
