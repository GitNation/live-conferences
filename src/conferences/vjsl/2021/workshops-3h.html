That's why we decided to build an integration between Vue Storefront- Lightning-Fast Frontend Platform for Headless Commerce, and Vendure - modern, headless GraphQL-based e-commerce framework. Both tools are built using modern JavaScript stack (Nuxt.js and Nest.js) and have several out of the box integrations like search engines, CMS's, payments, and so on. Also, both projects have a huge community of Open Source contributors who support the development process. In this presentation, I will show you how fast you can create your store with VSF and Vendure.",

In this workshop will look at how to make use of Ionic for building your app and how to deploy it to not only the web, but native as well.</p>

                       <p>Solving your front-end performance problems can be hard, but identifying where you have performance problems in the first place can be even harder. In this workshop, Abhijeet Prasad, software engineer at Sentry.io, dives deep into UX research, browser performance APIs, and developer tools to help show you the reasons why your Vue applications may be slow. He'll help answer questions like, "What does it mean to have a fast website?" and "How do I know if my performance problem is <em>really</em> a problem?". By walking through different example apps, you'll be able to learn how to use and leverage core web vitals, navigation-timing APIs, and distributed tracing to better understand your performance problems.</p>
