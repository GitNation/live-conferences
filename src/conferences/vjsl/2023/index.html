It can cost a lot of money and time to keep upgrading sunsetted versions.</p>\n<p>Open source is free for companies to use until the author sunsets a version.</p>\n<p>These are some best practices that we we recommend when considering open source adoption:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who is the author? Do they have a strong reputation that is going to be around for a long time? Do they have the resources to support an enterprise library?</li>\n<li>How much online support is there in the community for this library? How many dependencies are on this library?</li>\n<li>Does it have an end of life policy? What’s going to happen when they rev on a version? Will companies have an option to stay on older versions for a long time?</li>\n<li>What should you consider when migrating to a supported framework after a version has been sunsetted?</li>\n</ul>\n",

                    <p>Developer for (too) many years, I currently work using Python / Django in the backend and JavaScript / Vue.js in the frontend. Whenever possible, I try to contribute to projects on GitHub to help the open source community. I love exploring new technologies and new frameworks, trying to offer talks at international conferences to share what I learn, hoping it will be of help to other developers as well.</p>
