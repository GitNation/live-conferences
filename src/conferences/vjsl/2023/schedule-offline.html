                "description": "<p>Web forms are the connective tissue of the internet. Without them, people cannot request their health records, apply for university, order pad thai, or book a plane ticket. Yet too often, the tools we use to build those forms are a grab bag of libraries and DIY solutions that can result in a subpar user experience, poor accessibility, and low maintainability.</p>\n<p>In this talk, we will introduce FormKit — a form-building <em>framework</em> — and explore how this tool can empower Vue developers to write consistent, accessible, even delightful forms without spending a lifetime building them.</p>\n<p>Talk table of contents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The problem with forms, why they’re hard</li>\n<li>Introduction to FormKit</li>\n<li>Input library</li>\n<li>Validation</li>\n<li>Accessibility</li>\n<li>Form architecture</li>\n<li>Generating forms from JSON</li>\n<li>Next steps and closing statements</li>\n</ul>\n",
