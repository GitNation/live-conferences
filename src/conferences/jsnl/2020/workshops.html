Those kids are popping off while you're sitting around, coding SQL queries. Fortunately, we are technologists, and there's no problem we can't solve, including getting better at TikTok dancing. In this talk, I'll show you how I perfected my moves by building PoseDance, your friendly TikTok trainer. We'll discuss how I leveraged PoseNet, which allows you to pinpoint body motion and draw a 'skeleton' on a video. Combined with a webcam mapping your own dance skeleton, a bit of math to compare the matching points, Azure functions to authenticate a user, and PlayFab as a game-friendly backend to keep scores and create a leaderboard, you've got the perfect quarantine pastime, making a perfect fool of yourself in front of a webcam. Come dance with me!</p>\n",

                    <h3>Broken Promises (June 11-12) </h3>
                    <p>In our experience, if you are using promises, you are likely using them wrong (and nearly everybody else is too). This is most often due to misunderstandings about how Promises work, choices that were made by TC39 when designing the promises API, inconsistencies in how Promises are used, or failure to account for the cost of using Promises in an application, and ultimately how the event loop works. In this workshop, we aim to help developers do the right thing with Promises. Through a series of hands on exercises and puzzles, developers will learn the ins and outs of developing with Promises in Node.js, learning everything they should do, and most importantly what they shouldn't do, in order to maximize the effectiveness of their code and avoid common performance pitfalls.</p>

                    <h3>From Zero to Real-world GraphQL APIs (June 15) </h3>
                    <p>GraphQL is an excellent technology to model the data of a system and expose it in a very flexible way. It enables product engineers to build faster at scale by composing data requirements on the client and efficiently querying APIs. However, this new paradigm also brings new concerns and potential issues on the server-side. In this workshop, you will learn how to effectively create GraphQL APIs leveraging GraphQL advantages and avoiding common pitfalls.</p>

                    <p>TypeScript is taking the web platform by storm, mainly because it is so syntactically similar to JavaScript, but comes with powerful scalability features that create more robust products.

                    <p>Svelte is a new prominent JS framework exposing “write less do more” philosophy. During this workshop you will get proficiency as a Svelte developer. We will be building a real-time chat UI - participants will be able to follow along and exchange messages. Will start developing from simple front end components, later we'll connect it to a real backend and then test it and optimise for production. Attending a workshop is the fastest way to acquire a body of knowledge about building web apps with Svelte.</p>

                    <h3>Databases Made Easy with GraphQL and FaunaDB (June 16, for full-access tickets holders only) </h3>
                    <p>There are several things to consider when setting up a GraphQL endpoint:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>choosing a suitable database, </li>
                      <li>handling the n+1 problem, </li>
                      <li>using a cache, </li>
                      <li>security rules. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>GraphQL has moved the many requests problem from the HTTP layer to the database layer. Instead of many REST calls, we only need to execute one GraphQL request. However, one GraphQL request often results in many database calls, which basically moves the performance problem to the database layer.</p>
                    <p>FaunaDB is a distributed database that comes out-of-the-box with GraphQL and a flexible security layer. Import your schema, let FaunaDB generate the collections and indexes to support your schema, and you can benefit from a scalable, distributed GraphQL endpoint in 30 seconds. Due to the composable nature and graph-like querying features of the Fauna Query Language (FQL), FaunaDB can offer a GraphQL endpoint that compiles GraphQL queries to FQL one-on-one. No more n+1 problem, no cache needed, and since each GraphQL query translates to one query, you can also take advantage of FaunaDB's strong consistency and flexible security model.</p>
