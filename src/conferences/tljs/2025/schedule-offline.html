He guides companies to better results from their software projects while he helps individuals work with less stress. He wants everyone to actually realize the promised benefits of Lightweight approaches to software development, which includes making sense of the \"Agile\" chaos of the past quarter-century. Companies engage him for remote working sessions, training courses, on-site workshops, and in-person consulting visits. Individuals, especially those stuck in companies that don't have the budget for formal consulting, can get the help they need by joining J. B.'s mentoring group by visiting <a href=\"https://experience.jbrains.ca\">https://experience.jbrains.ca</a>. (Quite often, they can convince their employer to pay for that!) He lives in Atlantic Canada with his wife, Sarah, who is busy showing the Open Source world how to have quality documentation even with a mostly-volunteer project community. They travel to Europe less often than they used to, which makes each visit even more enjoyable.</p>\n",

Surprising, nuanced, and extremely relevant for any enterprise thinking about bringing AI tools into their software delivery process. In this session, we'll share productivity metrics, insights on code quality, cultural impact, and what we learned about pairing developers with AI.
