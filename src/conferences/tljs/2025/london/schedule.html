This talk tells the story of that journey. It will dive into the practical, human-centric playbook developed for rapid upskilling in the age of AI. The presenter, Tim Makin, will share how his team built not just an \"agentic engine room\" on AWS Bedrock and a suite of collaborator agents, but also a culture of intense, continuous learning and psychological safety. Attendees will leave with a replicable framework for transforming their own teams into AI-native powerhouses.</p>\n",

With its almost magical transpilation abilities, it is the innovation that was needed to kickstart the legacy modernisations that had been postponed for too long.</p><p>Having worked on critical modernisations for more than 15 years, I jumped on the opportunity to experiment with how LLMs can accelerate complex migration projects. </p><p>I will share the concrete experience we have accumulated on a wide range of stacks (Swift-&gt;React-Native, Eclipse RCP -&gt; Spring Boot, Java 1.6 Spring -&gt; Java 21 Spring Boot, PHP ZF1 -&gt; Symfony 7), cover both the good surprises and the limitations that we uncovered, and share our current playbook to best leverage AI when migrating a legacy system.</p>\n",
