At Typeform, we're proactively encouraging the use of AI tools, and helping everyone level-up their AI proficiency.This means lots of things including the flexibility to try different tools, democratising access to (but controlling our expenditure on) LLMs, and ensuring we're hiring the next generation of engineers who have AI as part of their DNA.In this talk, I'll provide some practical examples of how we're achieving these things at Typeform, as well as how we're enhancing the way we collaborate with people outside of engineering using AI tools.I'll share real examples using AWS Bedrock and MCP servers, plus hard-won lessons from our journey. If your team is on the path to AI transformation, this talk will give you some practical strategies for making it a success.",
