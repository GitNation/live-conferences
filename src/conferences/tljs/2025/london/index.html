With its almost magical transpilation abilities, it is the innovation that was needed to kickstart the legacy modernisations that had been postponed for too long.</p><p>Having worked on critical modernisations for more than 15 years, I jumped on the opportunity to experiment with how LLMs can accelerate complex migration projects. </p><p>I will share the concrete experience we have accumulated on a wide range of stacks (Swift-&gt;React-Native, Eclipse RCP -&gt; Spring Boot, Java 1.6 Spring -&gt; Java 21 Spring Boot, PHP ZF1 -&gt; Symfony 7), cover both the good surprises and the limitations that we uncovered, and share our current playbook to best leverage AI when migrating a legacy system.</p>\n",

This is becoming very worrying for corporates who have critical systems running on legacy code that only a handful of people still understand.That's where GenAI arrives. With its almost magical transpilation abilities, it is the innovation that was needed to kickstart the legacy modernisations that had been postponed for too long.Having worked on critical modernisations for more than 15 years, I jumped on the opportunity to experiment with how LLMs can accelerate complex migration projects. I will share the concrete experience we have accumulated on a wide range of stacks (Swift-&gt;React-Native, Eclipse RCP -&gt; Spring Boot, Java 1.6 Spring -&gt; Java 21 Spring Boot, PHP ZF1 -&gt; Symfony 7), cover both the good surprises and the limitations that we uncovered, and share our current playbook to best leverage AI when migrating a legacy system.",

Driven by a desire to create meaningful change, I joined forces with my fellow tech entrepreneur and friend, Christoph Lippuner, who had also seen the impact of disconnected care.  \n\nLeveraging our experience as tech entrepreneurs who had successfully exited their first start-up, we collaborated closely with doctors and healthcare staff to design an interoperable, all-in-one clinical system that truly meets their needs and enables them to amplify their impact. Today, Semble supports thousands of healthcare professionals across more than 77 specialities, helping to improve care for over 8 million patients.",

Driven by a desire to create meaningful change, I joined forces with my fellow tech entrepreneur and friend, Christoph Lippuner, who had also seen the impact of disconnected care.  \n\nLeveraging our experience as tech entrepreneurs who had successfully exited their first start-up, we collaborated closely with doctors and healthcare staff to design an interoperable, all-in-one clinical system that truly meets their needs and enables them to amplify their impact. Today, Semble supports thousands of healthcare professionals across more than 77 specialities, helping to improve care for over 8 million patients.",

                    <p>I like to introduce myself as a hybrid — part Enterprise Architect, part Senior Solution Architect. I thrive at both ends of the spectrum: shaping strategic E2E target state architectures and rolling up my sleeves to prototype Industrial IoT, AI and Edge solutions with expertise on Azure, AWS and Google Cloud. I’m passionate about solving complex problems, building future-ready platforms, and delivering impact across the products that we build. </p>
