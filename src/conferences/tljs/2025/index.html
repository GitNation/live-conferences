                "description": "<p>While AI tools excel at generating code, they can't navigate the human complexities that make or break technical decisions. As senior engineers, our value increasingly lies not in what we code, but in how we lead teams through technical choices that reflect our values and culture.</p><p>Through real examples of how values conflicts disguise themselves as technical disagreements, this session explores what tech leaders need to preserve and strengthen as AI reshapes our industry. You'll discover practical tools for uncovering team values and learn to make technical decisions that account for both code and culture in an AI-driven world.</p>\n",

LLMs and their offshoots can now easily solve take-home assessments, and traditional DSA formats reward memorisation over real-world skills. So how can we accurately and fairly assess the technical abilities of engineers as part of a standardised hiring process? In late 2024, I began a redesign of the technical interview process at HelloBetter, a mental health tech company in Berlin. The aim was to create a format that actually reflects day-to-day engineering work, while also being time-conscious, inclusive, and accepting of the presence of AI in developer workflows. In the process, we created \"The McDougall Method\": a new and emerging framework for better interview processes which is quickly forcing technical leaders to rethink their AI mitigation strategies.</p>\n",

                  "bio": "J. B. Rainsberger (@jbrains@mastodon.social) is a professional 5-pin bowler who enjoys consulting with software development professionals and the companies that employ them. He guides companies to better results from their software projects while he helps individuals work with less stress. He wants everyone to actually realize the promised benefits of Lightweight approaches to software development, which includes making sense of the \"Agile\" chaos of the past quarter-century. Companies engage him for remote working sessions, training courses, on-site workshops, and in-person consulting visits. Individuals, especially those stuck in companies that don't have the budget for formal consulting, can get the help they need by joining J. B.'s mentoring group by visiting https://experience.jbrains.ca. (Quite often, they can convince their employer to pay for that!) He lives in Atlantic Canada with his wife, Sarah, who is busy showing the Open Source world how to have quality documentation even with a mostly-volunteer project community. They travel to Europe less often than they used to, which makes each visit even more enjoyable.",

He guides companies to better results from their software projects while he helps individuals work with less stress. He wants everyone to actually realize the promised benefits of Lightweight approaches to software development, which includes making sense of the \"Agile\" chaos of the past quarter-century. Companies engage him for remote working sessions, training courses, on-site workshops, and in-person consulting visits. Individuals, especially those stuck in companies that don't have the budget for formal consulting, can get the help they need by joining J. B.'s mentoring group by visiting https://experience.jbrains.ca. (Quite often, they can convince their employer to pay for that!) He lives in Atlantic Canada with his wife, Sarah, who is busy showing the Open Source world how to have quality documentation even with a mostly-volunteer project community. They travel to Europe less often than they used to, which makes each visit even more enjoyable.",

At Modus Create, we ran a 3-month internal experiment to find out. Two squads were tasked with building the same app: one squad had full access to AI coding agents like GitHub Copilot and Cursor, while the other worked with zero AI assistance. The results? Surprising, nuanced, and extremely relevant for any enterprise thinking about bringing AI tools into their software delivery process. In this session, we&#39;ll share productivity metrics, insights on code quality, cultural impact, and what we learned about pairing developers with AI.

I&#39;ll show you how engineering teams work when coding agents handle implementation while humans focus on guidance and oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have built coding agents that have our team guidelines embedded - no more style guides or coding standards docs. You&#39;ll see agents that automatically follow our Next.js 15 patterns, Nx monorepo structure, shadcn/ui conventions, and more of our tech stack, while humans make small corrections that improve all future work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t about replacing engineers - it&#39;s about scaling the possibilities of your team through agent multiplication instead of hiring and restructurizations. I&#39;ll demonstrate the workflow where the agent implementation is followed by human refinement, creating consistent quality that doesn&#39;t depend on human variability.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;startDate&quot;:&quot;2025-09-16T14:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;endDate&quot;:&quot;2025-09-16T16:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;workshopExtensions&quot;:[{&quot;includedToPackage&quot;:true,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;September 16, 16:00-18:00 CET.

Based on my published research and enterprise experience, this workshop breaks down the complexity of deploying agentic systems responsibly.Â This workshop is aimed at senior engineers who are navigating cloud-native architectures while introducing autonomous AI components, without a clear blueprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contents:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. The New Complexity Stack&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â  Â  a) Microservices, AI, and third-party code generators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â  Â  b) Where system chaos starts and why it escalates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Understanding Agentic AI Behavior&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â  Â  a) Autonomy, memory, and hallucination risk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â  Â  b) Real-world examples from financial decision support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Design Patterns for Clarity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â  Â  a) Guardrails for system observability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â  Â  b) Tradeoffs: orchestration vs code generation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Scalability Without Burnout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â  Â  a) What senior engineers must lead: governance, ethics, reliability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â  Â  Â b) Designing systems that scale safely under load&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Takeaways&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â  Â  a) Agentic adoption roadmap&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â  Â  b) How to test and monitor non-deterministic AI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Â  Â  c) Alignment with team velocity and business outcomes&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;startDate&quot;:&quot;2025-09-17T14:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;endDate&quot;:&quot;2025-09-17T15:00:00.000Z&quot;,&quot;workshopExtensions&quot;:[{&quot;includedToPackage&quot;:true,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;September 17, 16:00-17:00 CET.
