Refactoring is a complex topic that doesn't have a one-size-fits-all solution. Frontend applications are particularly sensitive because of frequent requirements and user flows changes. New abstractions, updated patterns and cleaning up those old functions - it all sounds great on paper, but it often fails in practice: todos accumulate, tickets end up rotting in the backlog and legacy code crops up in every corner of your codebase. So a process of continuous refactoring is the only weapon you have against tech debt.</p>\n<p>In the past three years, I‚Äôve been exploring different strategies and processes for refactoring code. In this talk I will describe the key components of a framework for tackling refactoring and I will share some of the learnings accumulated along the way. Hopefully, this will help you in your quest of improving the code quality of your codebases.</p>\n",

It could very well be that you too have colleagues who work in the field.\nDevRel is a unique discipline aligned with every part of the business from engineering and product, to marketing, and even sales, and acts as a bridge between the company and the wider developer community.\nOur aligned incentives with engineering leadership are especially obvious in the fact that we exist to serve and enable developer audiences, whether external or internal.</p>\n<p>For engineering teams, working closely with your DevRel teams provides a great opportunity to better understand your developer audiences, raise the profiles and skills of your colleagues, and make your company more attractive for hiring. Yet, despite many DevRel teams being highly technical, because of DevRel‚Äôs perceived lack of focus, our departments are often dismissed as ‚Äújust marketing‚Äù by engineering.</p>\n<p>In this talk I will answer the question of ‚Äúwhat is it that DevRel people do‚Äù, and present some approaches for how DevRel and engineering can best collaborate and break down silos to benefit everyone, from the company to the wider developer community.</p>\n",

But how do we understand how much exactly we have of it? Where exactly does it sit? Which part of it is actually the most annoying? What would be the benefit for us if we spend time getting rid of it?  When it comes to planning how you tackle your tech debt, all these questions deserve answers. Especially when we're asked about the ROI on our efforts to eliminate some annoying legacy stuff and build a new shiny module or service. Also, when we work on tech debt, we do want to tackle the most impactful parts of it first, don't we?  This talk is about all of that: how we measure our tech debt, how we interpret the results of these measurements so that they give us the answers to the right questions, and how we guide our decision making with those answers.</p>\n",
