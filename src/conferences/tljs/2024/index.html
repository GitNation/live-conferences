And finally, meetings. Lots of them, long and short, exciting and boring... Does it sound familiar?</p><p><br /></p><p>To me, very. And it took me quite some time to figure out what to do with that.

                        "text": "<p>“Hell is other people.” There are many talks on how to get started as an engineer and how to step into management, but there are few talks about how to be an adult in (professional) relationships. I’ve spent my career in small companies and startups, FAANG organizations, and opensource communities. Each of these spaces demands different things of the people in them, yet across these spaces all succeed and fail along the fault lines of a core set of soft skills: regulating emotions, setting boundaries, framing experiences productively, and letting go. In this talk, I share everything I’ve learned in my career that has helped my colleagues, mentees, and friends so that you may navigate the most difficult part of tech—people—with grace, empathy, and safety.</p>\n",

And it took me quite some time to figure out what to do with that. I&#39;m going to share my recipe for taming the chaos with you.

She has delivered keynotes across three continents and trained teams from Auckland to Seattle. Vanessa launched her Talent Sourcing Training business in early 2019 and has not looked back. She is a qualified teacher with experience in agency recruiting and internal talent acquisition (she loved both roles!). She now gets to combine her love of empowering others to do better, with her passion for recruiting through her own Online Academy. She loves it when her training delegates experience that ‘light bulb’ moment as she knows that she has just changed someone’s career, for the better. When Vanessa is not doing research for her training, recording content, or delivering a Keynote, you can find her at the Beach or in the South African Bushveld, taking photographs.</p>

The best developers can deeply understand their business counterparts’ needs, effectively communicate technical strategy without losing the non-technical crowd, and convince the business to make the right decisions. Working at a consultancy, I’ve both failed and succeeded in architecting and “selling” technical visions, learning many lessons along the way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you work at a product company, are a consultant/freelancer, or want to venture beyond just being a developer, the ability to convince and clearly communicate with stakeholders can set you apart in the tech industry. This becomes even more important with the rise of GenAI and the increasingly competitive developer market, as problem-solving and effective communication are key to positioning yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, I’ll share real-world examples, both good and bad, and guide you through putting the theory into practice through dojos.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;prerequisites&quot;:null,&quot;content&quot;:[],&quot;additionalInfo&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:null,&quot;location&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Date &amp;#x26; time: June 24, 16:00-19:00 CEST.
