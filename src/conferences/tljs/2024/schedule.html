                    "description": "<p>Probably the most noticeable change engineers experience when they become leaders is the increase of day-to-day chaos. The moment you become responsible for the work of a team or a large area, tasks start coming at you. Dozens of them! Sometimes, per day. And also, questions. From everyone and their dog! And finally, meetings. Lots of them, long and short, exciting and boring... Does it sound familiar?</p><p><br /></p><p>To me, very. And it took me quite some time to figure out what to do with that. I'm going to share my recipe for taming the chaos with you. I'll talk about the components of that chaos, of reasons that they occur, and about solutions for avoiding it.</p>\n",

When he moved into leadership there was no support, so he had to make all the mistakes (a lot of them!) and learn from them.\nHis goal is now to make sure that tech leaders don’t have to do things the hard way by providing them with the mindsets and skillsets that can make them happy, confident and effective leaders.\nHis company, Tech Leaders Launchpad, currently focuses specifically on the new and emerging leader space, as that's the place we can have the biggest impact on the students, and the industry.</p>\n",
