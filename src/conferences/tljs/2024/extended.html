But what if there's a smarter approach that not only helps us retain what we learn but also enhances our workflow and productivity?</p><p><br /></p><p>We will explore why and how constructing a Second Brain can revolutionize the way developers work. By shifting our perspective and relying on our internal knowledge base, we can forge connections that enhance memory retention and improve our overall workflow. This presentation aims to delve into the core of the developer workflow, addressing commonly shared questions that are typically googled or answered using ChatGPT. Instead, we will focus on how adopting the habit of turning to our Second Brain can yield better results by providing answers in the context of our previous learning.</p>\n",

When he moved into leadership there was no support, so he had to make all the mistakes (a lot of them!) and learn from them.\nHis goal is now to make sure that tech leaders don’t have to do things the hard way by providing them with the mindsets and skillsets that can make them happy, confident and effective leaders.\nHis company, Tech Leaders Launchpad, currently focuses specifically on the new and emerging leader space, as that's the place we can have the biggest impact on the students, and the industry.</p>\n",
