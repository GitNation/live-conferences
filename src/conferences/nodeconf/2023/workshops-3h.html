Please see the website of your travel providers for more information.</p>\n<h3>Covid Policy</h3>\n<p>Our corona policy is in line with the government guidelines. This year we won’t be screening for temperature or checking proof of vaccination or recent negative test (PCR or rapid test). </p>\n<p>But we’re asking you to be responsible: if you have any symptoms or have been in contact with someone tested positive recently, please choose remote participation and watch the conference online, to ensure other attendees' safety.\nIt would be respectful to other attendees that attending people have either vaccination or recent PCR/rapid test, although this won't be enforced.\nIf you feel vulnerable at an event full of other people around you, you are welcome to wear masks, and we can provide them of course.</p>\n<p><strong>We provide the following measures at the in-person part of the event:</strong> </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sanitizer dispenser stations will be available inside the venue.</li>\n<li>Bathrooms cleaned frequently.</li>\n<li>Masks are optional and will be offered at the registration desk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Refund Policy</h3>\n<p>We understand that along the way, there might be obstacles for some attendees, as the situation with Covid’19 can always change. That’s why we can offer you several options for different cases:</p>\n<p><strong>Case 1</strong> : If an in-person ticket holder is not able to enter the UK due to Covid’s recent restrictions and informs us 14 days before the conference date - we can offer ticket transfer, downgrade to remote or refund.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 2</strong> : If an in-person ticket holder is not able to enter the UK due to Covid’s recent restrictions and informs us less than 14 days before the conference date - we can offer downgrade the ticket to remote and credits for 1-year GitNation Multipass, providing access to 10 additional remote events and dozens of talk &#x26; workshop recordings from our past conferences, or ticket transfer.</p>\n<p><strong>Case 3</strong> : If the in-person part of the event is cancelled due to the worsening situation with Covid, the whole event will be held online - all in-person ticket holders will receive a full remote ticket and the option of choosing between a 2-year GitNation Multipass, providing access to 20 additional remote events and tens of talk &#x26; workshop recordings from our past conferences, or a PRO remote workshop. We can also offer the opportunity to transfer your ticket to another future GitNation conference.</p>\n<p>When requesting a refund or changing the ticket type, please contact us via <a href=\"events@gitnation.org\">events@gitnation.org</a>. </p>\n",

At that point, it can point out the problem at the code level — allowing you to track down and fix those issues before they negatively impact end user experience.  This talk will focus on the tools available from the Open Source time series database InfluxDB. It will be using the open source node.js telegraf plugin, so you can easily collect key metrics to help you get that view into your application. We will be using the Node.js Monitoring Template which is prebuilt and equipped to monitor an applications' performance and availability.

                    "description": "<p>Observability is crucial for successfully operating large IoT fleets. IoT incorporates different components, including hardware, network, on-device software, and cloud. Devices operate under unreliable conditions and constraints, and need to be monitored remotely. Cloud applications become complex and costly, as they are built to handle device activity at scale. Answering questions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do I have a problem in my IoT application?</li>\n<li>Where is the problem?</li>\n<li>What is causing the problem?</li>\n<li>How much of my fleet is affected?</li>\n<li>Is my code expensive to run and if yes, how can I fix that? ,\ncan be challenging. Logging, monitoring and tracing are fundamental observability pillars. However, they are often viewed as non-functionals in IoT applications, and can fall off the radar, or are not standardized during development. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This session will show how to leverage Open Source tools, such as AWS Lambda PowerTools, in a fully functional Serverless IoT application, to ease adoption of best practices for modern application development, and integrate services such as Amazon X-Ray, Amazon CloudWatch and AWS IoT Core features, to achieve end-to-end observability. </p>\n",

In her free time, Karen embarrasses her 2 kids, spoils her dog, and feeds her addiction to adventure travel - not necessarily in that order. </p>\n",

Working on the backend means focusing on how and where the data is obtained from, whereas the frontend focuses on retrieving the data necessary for computation and display. This freedom of action, however, hides some possible performance problems. Fragments let you construct sets of fields, and then include them in queries where they’re needed. Often a client requests unnecessary data in an API call with the assumption that the extra fields are free. Instead, they are the cause of extra queries, sometimes even expensive ones. Not knowing the cost of a query makes it impossible to perform optimisation correctly.</p>\n",

                  <h3>Decomposing Monolith NestJS API into GRPC Microservices</h3>
                  <p>The workshop focuses on concepts, algorithms, and practices to decompose a monolithic application into GRPC microservices. It overviews architecture principles, design patterns and technologies used to build microservices. It covers the theory of the GRPC framework and protocol buffers mechanism, as well as techniques and specifics of building isolated TypeScript services in the Node.js stack. The workshop includes a live use case demo of decomposing an API application into set of microservices. It fits the best architects, tech leads, and developers who want to learn microservices patterns.</p>

                  <h3>Node.js Masterclass</h3>
                  <p>Have you ever struggled with designing and structuring your Node.js applications? Building applications that are well organised, testable and extendable is not always easy. It can often turn out to be a lot more complicated than you expect it to be. In this live event Matteo will show you how he builds Node.js applications from scratch. You’ll learn how he approaches application design, and the philosophies that he applies to create modular, maintainable and effective applications.</p>

                  <h3>JavaScript-based full-text search with Orama everywhere</h3>
                  <p>In this workshop, we will see how to adopt Orama, a powerful full-text search engine written entirely in JavaScript, to make search available wherever JavaScript runs. We will learn when, how, and why deploying it on a serverless function could be a great idea, and when it would be better to keep it directly on the browser. Forget APIs, complex configurations, etc: Orama will make it easy to integrate search on projects of any scale.</p>

                  <p>Multiple apis and multiple teams all in the same repository can cause a lot of headaches, but Nx has you covered. Learn to share code, maintain configuration files and coordinate changes in a monorepo that can scale as large as your organisation does. Nx allows you to bring structure to a repository with hundreds of contributors and eliminates the CI slowdowns that typically occur as the codebase grows.</p>

                  <p>Passwordless authentication may seem complex, but it is simple to add it to any app using the right tool.</p>
                  <p>We will enhance a full-stack JS application (Node.JS backend + React frontend) to authenticate users with OAuth (social login) and One Time Passwords (email), including:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>User authentication - Managing user interactions, returning session / refresh JWTs</li>
                    <li>Session management and validation - Storing the session for subsequent client requests, validating / refreshing sessions</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>At the end of the workshop, we will also touch on another approach to code authentication using frontend Descope Flows (drag-and-drop workflows), while keeping only session validation in the backend. With this, we will also show how easy it is to enable biometrics and other passwordless authentication methods.</p>

                  <h3>Decoupling in Practice</h3>
                  <p>Deploying decoupled and microservice applications isn't just a problem to be solved on migration day. Moving forward with these architectures depends completely on what your team's workflow experience will look like day-to-day post-migration.</p>
                  <p>The hardest part of this can often be the number of vendors involved. Some targets are best suited for specific frontend frameworks, while others are more so for CMSs and custom APIs. Unfortunately their assumptions, workflows, APIs, and notions of security can be quite different. While there are certain advantages to relying on a strict contract between apps – where backend and frontend teams work is limited to a single vendor – this isn't always realistic. This could be because you're still experimenting, or simply the size of your organization doesn't allow for this kind of specialization just yet.</p>
                  <p>In this workshop, you'll have a chance to explore a different, single vendor approach to microservices using Strapi and Next.js as an example. You'll deploy each app individually, establishing a workflow from the start that simplifies customization, introducing new features, investigating performance issues, and even framework interchangeability from the start.</p>

                    <li>Deploying the project</li>

                  <h3>Scaling up Your Database With ReadySet</h3>
                  <p>The database can be one of the hardest parts of a web app to scale. Many projects end up using ad-hoc caching systems that are complex, error-prone, and expensive to build. What if you could drop in a ready-built caching system to enable better throughput and latency with no code changes to your application?</p>
                  <p>Join developers Aspen Smith and Nick Marino to see how you can change one line of config in your app and use ReadySet to scale up your query performance by orders of magnitude today.</p>
