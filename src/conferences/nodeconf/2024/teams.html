In this talk, we will cover our rationale for deciding to do so, why DSLs are a compelling option, their pros and cons, and what it has enabled us to build for full-stack JavaScript devs so far. Additionally, we will cover some of the ups and downs of open source devtool development from our nearly three-year journey since Y Combinator (YC)</p>\n",
