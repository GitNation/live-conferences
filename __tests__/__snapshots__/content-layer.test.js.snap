    "codeOfConductMain": "<h2>The Short Version</h2>
<p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>
<h2>The Long Version</h2>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>
<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>

Component libraries tend to have giant APIs, dozens of components, hundreds of props and thousands of permutations. That is a lot of information to unpack.

We could make the documentation very long or... super interactive. We combined component previews, API documentation, props editing and code editing into a single seamless experience. You can quickly explore various settings of each component while watching the code write itself.

This talk will show you how to leverage common tools and concepts such as Prettier, babel and AST transformations to build the documentation that can literally work for you.",

<p>In this workshop, you'll learn everything you need to diagnose, profile, and fix performance problems in your React application using the Browser Performance Profiler, React DevTools Profiler, and proven React optimization techniques.</p>
<p>The tools we have for profiling React Applications are extremely powerful, but they can often be really difficult to grok. Sure, starting a profiling session is simple enough, but how do you go from all the information in the flamegraph to actionable steps to improve your application's performance? And once you know what parts of your app are causing performance issues, what then? How do you optimize your React components without making the whole application a complex mess?</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget that you should profile your app in production mode to make sure you get accurate measurements. Do you know how to do that?</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Kent C. Dodds and in my latest workshop I'll teach you the ins and outs of optimizing React applications. I will take you on a deep dive browser profiling tools, and show you what you need to know to start using them to make your applications fast right away.</p>

<p>In this workshop, you'll learn everything you need to diagnose, profile, and fix performance problems in your React application using the Browser Performance Profiler, React DevTools Profiler, and proven React optimization techniques.</p>
<p>The tools we have for profiling React Applications are extremely powerful, but they can often be really difficult to grok. Sure, starting a profiling session is simple enough, but how do you go from all the information in the flamegraph to actionable steps to improve your application's performance? And once you know what parts of your app are causing performance issues, what then? How do you optimize your React components without making the whole application a complex mess?</p>
<p>Oh, and don't forget that you should profile your app in production mode to make sure you get accurate measurements. Do you know how to do that?</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Kent C. Dodds and in my latest workshop I'll teach you the ins and outs of optimizing React applications. I will take you on a deep dive browser profiling tools, and show you what you need to know to start using them to make your applications fast right away.</p>

<p>We'll explore all the advanced techniques for making flexible and maintainable React components. We'll see how using popular patterns like Higher Order Components, Compound Components, Render Props etc. can help us in simplifying things, making our components more reusable and our apps more declarative.</p>
<p>React 16 comes with some major changes and an update to the core algorithm. In this module, we'll explore some practical use-cases for Hooks, Portals, Fragments, Error Boundaries etc. We'll see how the new Context API can simplify state-management and we'll play with a new feature called react-call-return.</p>
