We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.</p>\n<h2>The Long Version</h2>\n<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>\n<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>\n<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>\n<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>\n<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.</p>\n<p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference.

Automated machine learning (AutoML) eliminates the routine steps in the machine learning workflow, thus empowering domain experts without machine learning background to build good initial models, and allowing experienced practitioners to focus additional manual model optimization. This talk describes the extent of automation available for the various steps and demonstrates AutoML with a classifier for human activities based on accelerometer sensor data.",

          "text": "<p>The domain of Natural Language Processing have seen a tremendous amount of research and innovation in the past couple of years to tackle the problem of implementing high quality machine learning and AI solutions using natural text. Text Classification is one such area that is extremely important in all sectors like finance, media, product development, etc. Building up a text classification system from scratch for every use case can be challenging in terms of cost as well as resources, considering there is a good amount of dataset to begin training with.</p>\n<p>Here comes the concept of transfer learning. Using some of the models that has been pre-trained on terabytes of data and fine-tuning it based on the problem at hand is the new way to efficiently implement machine learning solutions without spending months on data cleaning pipeline.</p>\n<p>This talk with highlight ways of implementing the newly launched BERT and fine tuning the base model to build an efficient text classifying model.

          "description": "The domain of Natural Language Processing have seen a tremendous amount of research and innovation in the past couple of years to tackle the problem of implementing high quality machine learning and AI solutions using natural text. Text Classification is one such area that is extremely important in all sectors like finance, media, product development, etc. Building up a text classification system from scratch for every use case can be challenging in terms of cost as well as resources, considering there is a good amount of dataset to begin training with.\n\nHere comes the concept of transfer learning. Using some of the models that has been pre-trained on terabytes of data and fine-tuning it based on the problem at hand is the new way to efficiently implement machine learning solutions without spending months on data cleaning pipeline.\n\nThis talk with highlight ways of implementing the newly launched BERT and fine tuning the base model to build an efficient text classifying model.

First of all, it will require a very big data set to train the model what can be expensive or even not possible. On the other hand, computer vision systems can be modeled only by using a hand-drawn template image. Training AI models also requires GPUs. Nevertheless, I do not want to encourage everyone to train AI models for solving any simple problem which could be solved easily by computer vision.

Automated machine learning (AutoML) eliminates the routine steps in the machine learning workflow, thus empowering domain experts without machine learning background to build good initial models, and allowing experienced practitioners to focus additional manual model optimization. This talk describes the extent of automation available for the various steps and demonstrates AutoML with a classifier for human activities based on accelerometer sensor data.",

Key features of DeepPavlov Agent include (1) scalability and reliability in the high load environment due to micro-service architecture; (2) ease of adding and orchestrating conversational skills; (3) shared dialogue state memory and NLP annotations accessible to all skills.\n\nDeepPavlov DREAM is a socialbot platform with a modular design with the main components such as annotators, skills and selectors run as independent services. These components are conﬁgured and deployed using Docker containers. It allows developers to focus on application development instead of focusing on the intrinsic details of the manual low-level infrastructure conﬁguration.",

      "description": "<p>Simple chatbots can be built with a number of simple rules, but their UX will be very narrow and limited. Building complex AI assistants, in contrast, requires a lot of effort. To make your users happy, you have to master many things at once: rules, intents, finite state machines, chit-chat tech, dialog flow management, and many other things. It's a job for an entire team. Fortunately, you don't have to hire it. Instead, you can rely upon your trusty software from DeepPavlov.ai. With it, you can offload the complexity of managing the entire infrastructure to DeepPavlov Agent – an open-source Conversational AI orchestrator. Next, you can pick state-of-the-art NLP components from DeepPavlov Library to decode human emotions and understand their intents. Finally, you can pick some of the available skills from DeepPavlov Dream to avoid reinventing the wheel like chit-chat. </p>\n<p>In this workshop, you'll be guided through the entire process, from an overview of the platform to building a sample AI assistant that you'll be able to re-use later in your own work. </p>\n<p>By the end of this workshop you'll be able to use the provided components from the DeepPavlov family of projects to build  simple AI assistant:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>work with existing NLP components from DeepPavlov Library like sentiment and emotion classifiers</li>\n<li>build simple goal-oriented skill with DeepPavlov Go-Bot</li>\n<li>combine them together with the DeepPavlov Agent into a simple AI assistant</li>\n<li>augment your simple AI assistant with some of the DeepPavlov Dream pre-built skills</li>\n</ul>\n",

At the same time in reality it is difficult to integrate a real model into the current infrastructure, debug, test, deploy, and monitor it properly. In this workshop, I will guide you through this process by sharing tips, tricks, and favorite open source tools that will make your life much easier. So, at the end of the workshop, you will know where to start your deployment journey, what tools to use, and what questions to ask.</p>\n",
